Proud to mentor a number of PhD students, each possessing an inquisitive mind seeking to find solutions to challenging research questions. A number of my recent research papers features these bright young minds as my co-authors.

## Current PhD students

### Andrew Parry

Andrew Parry is my current PhD student at the University of Glasgow. Andrew's PhD topic involves investigation of **adversarial learning** for neural models.

### Manish Chandra

[Manish Chandra](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=W2JbsRQAAAAJ&hl=en) is my current student who's doing a PhD (part-time) at the University of Glasgow. Manish's PhD topic involves investigation of **explanation methodologies** and their **quantitative evaluation**. He completed his post-graduation from [IIT-KGP](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) in 2021.


### Chandan Biswas

[Chandan Biswas](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=W2JbsRQAAAAJ&hl=en) is a PhD student of mine registered at the [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/). I co-supervise his PhD along with [Ujjwal Bhattacharya](https://www.isical.ac.in/~ujjwal/). Chandan's work investigates how to develop both unsupervised and supervised **learning models under privacy preservation constraints** (specifically useful in a distributed computing environment in an untrusted network).

### Suchana Dutta

[Suchana Dutta ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suchana-datta-94ba942b/) is a PhD student at University College, Dublin (UCD). Her primary supervisor from UCD is [Derek Greene](http://derekgreene.com/).  With her I'm pursuing novel search interfaces and algorithms towards addressing causality driven search, i.e. where a search user wants to find out documents answering the *Why* question, e.g. *why was Osama bin Laden assassinated?* etc. 


## Mentored students

## Past PhD/mentored students

[Dwaipayan Roy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zmc1M2UAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) graduated out of the [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/) with his PhD degree in 2019. He was the first PhD student of mine (co-supervised by [Mandar Mitra](https://www.isical.ac.in/~mandar/)). His PhD investigated the use of embedded word representations for the purpose of improving retrieval effectiveness.

### Procheta Sen

[Procheta Sen](https://procheta.github.io/sprocheta/index.html) is now a lecturer in the University of Liverpool. I mentored her research durong her PhD studies at the [School of Computing, Dublin City University](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/), Dublin, Ireland. Her PhD supervisor was [Gareth J.F. Jones](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~gjones/), who was also my PhD supervisor. In her PhD studies, she has investigated effective ways to model and evaluate **proactive information retrieval** (i.e. **zero-shot/few-shot** information retrieval). She is also interested in embedding algorithms and multi-objective neural learning.  

### Anirban Chakraborty

[Anirban Chakraborty](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~achakrab/) was a PhD student at the [School of Computer Science, Trinity College Dublin](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/). His PhD topic includes investigating information retrieval (IR) based approaches for effective **points-of-interest (POI) recommendation**. I menotored him during his PhD studies.

### Swarup Chattopadhyay

[Swarup Chattopadhay](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=7PI1amoAAAAJ) was a PhD student at the [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/). With Swarup, I'm investigating faster and more effective solutions of standard **graph optimization** problems, such as clique, coloring, community funding etc. using **embedded representations of graph nodes**.
