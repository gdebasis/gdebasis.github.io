it  a scottish drink and it  banned some countries and i was wondering if anyone here has tried it  it has quite a unique taste and it  not something you  forget quickly  you either love it or hate it i think 
the absolute worst soda ive ever had that i can remember is probaly the new mystery fanta or watermelon strawberry tango some other ones include mango coke sugar free irn bru  but xtra is nice 
i  like to repurchase this tea but i cannot find the exact box and don   want to buy something i am not sure will be good 
hi i have a question  someone joined our party     he said my city state and i live in a smaller city that goes to a big city so to name my specific city is scary to say the least     he kept kicking us out of the party despite the fact that he was not the party leader  this was most definitely being done by a kid  so what am i supposed to do when this happens  other than report it is there any other recourse 
which means no contact unless previously stipulated 
i used a specialized scale and i am only     water instead of     water  how do i force myself to drink more 
i have found lots of tea apparently from the early     online however i don   know what sites   companies to trust  
i am looking for an anniversary present and would like tea either grown or processed in       or as close as possible   any advice on this would be most helpful 
i am based in the uk so something which can ship here without too much trouble would be great 
thanks  have a great day

the tapping tapir with    flavours

like    or so years ago i loved this game and i can   remember it now   
it was a game show battle royale thing where all the  contestants killed each other for a prize 
the only characters i remember are a naked lady purple penguin named eugene and a little rich girl named  charity  
i just need the name for the game     thank you  
i   pretty sure i can but just to be sure  can i make an account before i even turn the system on  or could i just go to the xbox website and just make an account 
what  a good water bottle to get  all mine are cheap or broken 
it started over the labor day holiday in the us  i was visiting my parents and two separate royal farms convenience stores i went to only had a nos turbo available  the shelves for the other flavors varieties were empty 
this caused me to look and notice several open slots around the refrigerator case  but they live on a peninsula at the beach so i chalked it up to distribution issues locally  now back at home i   still seeing only certain flavors of nos  available and several open rows of other drinks in my local sheetz and i can no longer pick up the   pack from my grocery store  granted the grocery store has always been a little hit or miss about keeping it in stock 
anyone know if this is this poor inventory management or a symptom of a supply chain issue 
it seems like we haven   heard about them for like   months  i was looking forward to getting one but we have been in the dark about their release dates  i don   want to buy the kit because it  over      more than if i waited for the official release  not worth it 
about a month ago i purchased a soda stream machine   i  been having fun with it   yesterday my work decided to get rid of their fountain drink setup   they said i could have all the leftover syrups   i got   gallons of cherry pepsi   gallons of diet pepsi  yuck     gallon of mountain dew and   gallons of sierra mist 
i still haven   figured out the exact ratio of water syrup   the   liter soda stream bottles seem to take around         cup of syrup 
does anyone know if there  any online retailers that don   put you in a queue for the xbox series x  for some reason i always get unreleastic queue times last longer than the stock does when using walmart plus   i   using the paid version not the trial  
i   gonna give making milk tea w  boba a try  what brands of black breakfast tea do you use  preferably ones that can be found on amazon or that have free shipping  any tips  thank you

mods are auto removing any comments regarding performance issues on the ac sub so i figured i would share my concerns here instead 
even as a long time ubisoft customer i am really blown away by the out of the box performance issues 
i can   even get    fps on high medium settings with my gtx      stuttering is terrible and medium detail levels look really bad  having played this back to back with legion i would almost say that game ran better 
just thought i  share incase anyone wanted to avoid these issues on launch day 
edit 
for everyone asking what cpu and what resolution i      k and     x     ultrawide  i didn   think to include it because i already knew on my end that my issues aren   coming from a cpu or memory bottleneck 
also i want to add that i   a big fan of the changes this game made and so far it  my favorite ac yet 
i am a licensed insurance producer coming off the tail end of medicare annual enrollment  i have been looking for another insurance position and have been actively applying on indeed  the other day i was contacted by someone from the hart group  i dug through my applied jobs and was perplexed when i found nothing under that name  it hasn   been uncommon for me to receive outbound contacts from agencies especially prior to accepting my last position so i thought nothing of it at first 
today however i realized my mistake  
the fact that i never applied for this position should have been the one and only red flag  as i logged onto the  overview  zoom call i was given the name american income life  that immediately set off the alarm bells in my head  in my research pertaining to getting my accident and health license i found a few pyramid schemes around and that was one of them  the deeper into the overview we got the more red flags were raised  they promised major commission   k  a year starting out they promised vacations and rewards they promised this and that and then some  there were sock reviews all over talking about the pay and being your own boss  every statement and empty promise was textbook mlm recruitment garbage  i was shocked  i was being recruited for an mlm 
defeated i left the zoom call and told them i am not interested in the position  
i wholeheartedly believed i would never be someone who fell for the initial tactics i would never let them get a foot in the door but if i didn   know any better and i wasn   staunch in my position pertaining to commission only roles i  no doubt they would have sunk their teeth into me 
it  a cold world out there  stay alert 
this is my first time buying higher than bad quality loose leaf teas  
i wanna sample different teas from an online store here i got   g each of   diff  kinds of oolongs    jin xuan and   tgy  and   dried chamomile  i wanna brew the oolongs gongfu style but i can only drink     cups max  my doctor  recommendation   
can i get the same amount of cups if i do gongfu   save the leftovers for re infusion  
how can i save the leftover leaves 
or should i just stick to western 
i have some gongfu experience with some cheap roasted oolong tea leaves lasted around     infusions  i stored them on a bowl lined with paper towels left on the counter top idk if this is optimal or not 
since the pre orders have begun already in some countries  i pre ordered xsx in india already  we should have new community flairs for xss and xsx put up 
i was watching a gta v video on youtube and it looked really amazing and super smooth  but yet when i play my games at     fps they don   seem to look anything like that 
any ideas why this is 
i know some of us are unhappy with the     price tag  
i like these fruit flavored teas strawberry cherry lemon echinachea etc 
however most of them advertise that they are caffeine free 
why  is there some reason they omit it 
same thing with chai tea  what gives 
i   in the early stages of designing new coffee cups for my café  looking for some inspiration but don   know where to look  i don   really have the time to go shop to shop looking at coffee cups  p

any advice and or recommendations gladly welcome 
i  noticed under the electrical info on the serial number sticker there is a wh ####   do those numbers correlate to the month and year it was made   can anyone confirm   it sure seems that way from the many stickers ive seen   
i just got gifted one and they told me it was refurbished   but it looks new and the wh says        if i got a nov      unit then hot dog     too bad the burrs arent ditting     i wonder if its worth the      to get those burrs   i have a discerning plate these days   coffee out of anything less than an ek   is quite obvious to me 
gosh seriously i should  known better  i   an avid mlm hater and i visit this sub at least  x a day  my best friend  who is a yl shiller and whose fb posts i  shared here  sent me a text asking if she could add me to a fb group  
i   working and watching an episode of workaholics so i was pretty distracted and wasn   even thinking  so when i logged onto fb i get invited to this page and saw that it was   r f  should i stay for a few days and see if there  anything interesting to post here or leave asap  lol

has anyone seen diet dr pepper and cream soda  ive only seen the sugar one and i wasnt sure if i was just missing it or if it was not really being sold yet 
 i live in pennsylvania u s  btw 
noticed new egg hasnt started their pre orders for the x yet  anyone know when they will start 
i got a small idea that might interest you guys and the mods what if this subreddit sold  r tea teacups  the teacup wouldn   be heavily promoted there would just be a small link in the sidebar of  r tea to where you can buy it 
this could really help this subreddit the mods  if they are willing  could sell the teacups and promise that all revenue would be put into working on this subreddit  paying coders so we can get an awesome looking subreddit contests giveaways    
if enough of us are willing to show we would be interested maybe the mods will think about it we would be able to buy cool teacups and help this subreddit 

tldr  would you want this
monoprice just listed a new     ips on their website this being a month or two after discontinuing their two older     models with no word of what to expect 
http   www monoprice com product c_id    &cp_id      &cs_id        &p_id      &seq  &format  
does anyone know what is different about this new ips  they state led backlit specifically on this one  maybe these new     are actually led backlit unlike the older models which so many complained of  i am tempted to pre order this display if anyone knows of a good discount code speak forth

yesterday i was in a nice consignment shop and they had some really nice things from some higher end brands 
then i ran across this rack of skirts that were all really cheesy color combos and the quality felt really cheap   all were brand new and the tags were still on   the tags said  lularoe    i thought about this sub and could picture in my mind the hun hauling all that stuff  to the consignment shop
apart from the og ph king tap water what commercial water should i get 
hi there everyone 
i recently came across dragon marked for death and went to purchase it recently however i went and looked at the dlc list and went  oh hey it has all the other stuff let me buy that instead  
because of that small overlook i now own all the dlc which includes all   character dlc  but i don   own the game 
since i don   own the game i can   access the dlc in anyway shape or form yet i own the dlc is there any way i can possibly get one of the dlc  refunded or something so i can buy the actual game itself or am i stuck to buying something i own already again 
p s
i  already tried to get into contact with a service rep and they basically said that i   unable to refund anything and will have to buy the game even though i already own all the content for it  
i have joined this sub and i hope to further our bond through our live if the sacred liquid
we know with the original reveal trailer of the switch they used splatoon is an e sports environment  so it seems like nintendo is pushing for this game to be a dominant e sports platform  even in summer of      i believe nintendo hosted official splatoon tournaments in europe  however i feel the same lacks the  eye candy  to appeal as an e sports and i   not referencing graphics  splatoon always starts off by splatting your surroundings and using your environment to take out enemies  but the overall premise is covering more of the zone i feel it  not appealing to watch  however that  just my opinion would like to hear what you guys have to say perhaps can even change my perspective on this matter  
so i   currently on the hunt for a job and i   focusing on marketing managegement i applied on one of these job websites for a good job for a rather well known business  after i did so the site gave me the option to  apply to    similar jobs in my area   i figured why not  big mistake 
the next morning i got countless phone calls to set up a meeting with them  something seemed a little fishy about all of them  never heard of the companies sales job with possibilities for growth depending on performance etc  i looked up reviews for working for these companies and they were mostly positive except for a select few saying that it  a pyramid scheme and that it  a door to door sales job etc  i  been invited to join an mlm called primerica years ago by my neighbor which opened my eyes to this garbage but i had no idea it was such a common thing  be wary guys  it  not just boss babes selling their essential oils   
everyone seems to be throwing positives and negatives around about rocket league but i was wondering how l a  noire runs from people who pre ordered digitally  i   really excited to see how it plays anyone out there played it yet 
hi guys 
they are going to be bringing my ps  bundle in a luggage and my friend   who got his delivered the same way  got his digital code or whatnot lost in the way  i just want to know how in what form does the code or whatever it is comes in to let the person who is bringing my ps  know 
thanks in advanced for your answers 
when dialing in a coffee i normally just wing it on changing one variable at a time   which variable do most of you change first  or which usually gives you the best results  dose size grind water temp or anything else 
i  been drinking a lot of bubbly la croix and polar sparkling water  is that good enough to be a hydro homie 
obviously i will be getting basic things google chrome steam electric sheep screen saver etc  i   purchasing a windows   upgrade as well  my question is what other fun software is recommended  cosmetic or otherwise  it is a i  with   gb ram a radeon hd      gb video card with a   terabyte harddrive  so is there any special software i should definitely go out of my way to get  
sorry i don   have greater detail on my specs  if you need me to get them to better answer my question lemmie know 
hey all 
so my girlfriend and i are getting ready for our first christmas together and i   trying to find us a good game to play 
we used to play a bunch of overwatch and splitgate but we ' re a little over them for the time being  i   a little halo and ff xiv obsessed at the moment   
we ' re both fans of mmo  shooters strategy games and rpg   i  been looking around today and haven   had anything wow me yet so i come to you folks 
any recommendations  
thanks and happy holidays everyone 
this game has a bunch of stuff to uncover and i love how its up to you to decide which things need to be prioritized  
in my first game i was all exploration but then i was left defenseless when barbarians attacked my civilization    so i bought a bunch of warriors to fend them off  ok problem solved  but now my civilization is getting crowded and i need to prioritize builders  oops no money for builders  my citizens are beginning to rebel  
this game requires you to sit down and think about all your options to make sure the one you choose is best for everybody  theres also a bunch of texts to read for each object skill or idea you can choose to discover in this game  
i am really happy with this purchase and i recommend this game for anyone looking for a solid single player experience 👍 
also i read that new players should get the dlc but which ones do i get  theres so many  any experienced players want to share which ones are the best 
i wanted to buy this digitally but here in ireland it  not on the store  is there any reason for this and if i purchase it on the us store will it be in my library 
there is a new page for the series x  will the pre order be in the learn more section

edit  he told the truth about it working not how he got it working 
with jedi knight coming out today on the switch it got me thinking about other star wars games  i just love the games from that era  i would love the kotor series on the switch  
do we think it  possible we get other older games or even more new ones  what star wars games would you want to see 
also i love the gyro aim they added any game with it feels so much smoother  it really makes the game feel less archaic
edit  if the kotor games were to include touch controls if they ever came to the switch that would really streamline the dense menus
is it ok for me to drink coffee in the mornings  but i still drink a good amount of water is it ok 
so i live in brazil and technology is pretty expensive here i was using a   gb sd card on my switch and so far so good but i wanted to play l a noire on it and i found out that it requires a ~  gb on the digital version so i found out that i have a   gb sd card that i used on my  ds since i   not playing anymore i could use it to play l a noire  digital version  in theory but i have   concerns that i could not find the answer here on this subreddit 
   can i make the l a noire download on a   gb sdcard   it seems like a dumb question but i don   know if the switch will install something on the sd or if the   gb will be fully avaliable i just wanna be sure because i dont want to erase all my  ds games and saves for nothing 
   is it manageable to use multiple sd cards on the switch  since i have some other games and saves on my   gb sdcard i would only use the   gb to play l a noire and keep the other games on the   gb 
i   sorry about my english its not my native language 
i cant find this one anywhere even ebay  is it still being made  if anyone has some to sell i   willing to pay     for a single can if you put it up on ebay 
how can i contact  them after    hours of my suspension 
i   looking for a product or combination if products  i have pkd  polycystic kidney disease   i religiously drink my    ml of water every day  but it  getting really annoying to fill my britta filter   times a day  is there something i can get that filters all     ml at once  i drink well water so not filtering isnt an option  i also dont want to invest in a water cooler

i love my hario skerton hand grinder but it seems to take forever to grind by hand  especially on a lazy morning before i  had my coffee  so i built a stand to run the grinder for me 
i initially powered the grinder with a hand drill which is a common mod  but that was a clunky solution and i got tired of not having my drill in the garage where it belonged 
so after i received a capresso infinity burr grinder for christmas i started this side project for the decommissioned skerton   i am happy with how it turned out 
compared to the capresso i think i prefer the powered skerton  grind quality is comparable but the skerton is of much simpler construction and is easier to clean  also with the screw on container it does a better job of containing the grounds so there is less mess 
anyway it was a fun project and i hope you find it interesting  cheers 
i was just checking what  new as always and saw that must be an error because it costs    usd everywhere else 
hard to find cheap and or interesting a bonus 
early on in the runup to switch and particularly the lite nintendo was talking about how they could have multiple consoles in one family  so my brother  dad of   adult and   kids  got a switch and i was hoping to be able to share my library of games with them  
unfortunately it does not work that way  i  either have to make theirs the  primary console  and become a guest in my own house so to speak or make theirs a secondary and give up exclusivity over my saves  since they  have to play  as me  to use the software   
this is really a user hostile system and contra the idea that  everyone can play together  it mandates that if the kids get lites eventually they  need multiple copies of the same game to play versus  
nintendo could probably generate stronger sales of the online family plan if it let you share your digital purchases across all switches whose primary users are in the family group  as it is only the nes and snes games can be shared  
guess i can still loan physicals at least 
ok so i ran my laptop through the will it run thing and everything came back ok except for my video card  apparently its just not a supported type but it looks like its more than powerful enough  does this mean i can run oblivion or not 
for reference i can run portal   dawn of war ii and a bunch of older games no problem 
was just thinking does hario even sell replacement drippers for these  they don   have the base of the standard v   dripper so if you lost or broke it somehow that would be a pain
mine is just cause  
holy this is the most comments i  ever gotten thanks guys
i bought this game on a whim because i have always loved rhythm music games and it blew me away  it isn   very long but the soundtrack is amazing and the levels are short enough that you can quickly replay any of them  it  a nice mix of synthpop electronic and lo fi beats  the graphics are also nice to look at and will make you feel like you  invested some sort of hallucinogen  it  currently on sale for around    and is easily worth the money  check it out 
so a little back story  i don   consider myself a coffee drinker but rather a coffee fan  on an overly aggressive week i drink coffee maybe   times however when i do i enjoy  good coffee   most of the time i brew it myself using a french press    i  gotten pretty consistent results for a quick work cup   for about   years now i have been ordering my beans from happy mug and i really enjoy their stuff  i started with their flavored coffees but recently i got their  unflavored stuff  and even more recently i accidently ordered whole beans without having a grinder  after getting a cheap grinder i am now diving head first into a true home setup with multiple brew option  but this is all irrelevant    really what i want to know is what beans do you love and from where 
tl dr i love ordering from happy mug but what else is good

inconsistent graphics some of the worst va i  ever heard not much discovery mechanics you could mostly do with paper  
what is wrong with me  why do i keep playing   
yesterday i decided to apply for almost a dozen jobs on indeed focusing around remotely working from home  within an hour i got a call from a gal from a business i didn   recognize that wanted to help me set up a phone interview for the following day  she kept asking me if i had any questions but i wasn   sure what position it was for so i set up a time and she stated she would send me an email with intro videos to prepare me for the interview  as soon as i got off the phone i looked through my applications and could not find where i applied for some  agency  and decided to look through the email she sent  within    seconds on the first video i thought  this sounds like an mlm   turns out the agency was a local symmetry financial group which primarily sells mortgage insurance  pulled up the master list on this subreddit and sure enough they are on there  i  never been so frustrated but at this point i   wondering if indeed sold my info to this  agency  because i definitely didn   apply for it and would have no idea how else they could have gotten my information 
serious question     last few nights after returning to m&k       i just cant seem to get comfortable with it  holding mouse feels weird and ive no clue where to put my arm on the table  i swap between arm hanging off or arm layed on table with elbow just hanging off  thoughts  p s whats your positions 
for example if you get the first ending of mario odyssey you get bowser peach and mario in their wedding suits and if you get     moons you get a golden mario icon  something along the lines of that not hugely necessary of course but it  be a neat feature 
here  why 
   it makes a crunch sound 
   it  cold so it  always refreshing 
   it tastes like water 
   c r u n c h
i  been getting into more gongfu style brewing since i got a porcelain gaiwan from ys and i   really enjoying it  i typically brew in the office kitchen but the issue with that is the kettle is out of reach from the table which means i   getting up every few minutes to grab water for another brew 
i  love a simple solution to keep water at the ideal temperature without having to get up and down non stop to get it from the kettle  
suggestions 
so i  been enjoying my breville    xl and hg    i have a couple of questions that maybe some of you have input on  
   after i brew knock do a   second head purge and then a   second basket cleanse some liquid is trapped between the portafilter and basket  it  not much but is i imagine it  not improving the taste of the next shot  do you guys that run into this take the basket off dump the excess and then run some clean water through  
   if i pick up my grinder to move it for cleaning purposes i lose my burr setting  there doesn   seem to be a phone number for people to ask the manufacturer any questions  is this common or can i make an allen wrench adjustment somewhere to prevent this from happening 
thanks  
ive been getting targeted ads from them for like a year on ig and im so close to buying one  the thing is i do not need another pricey reusable water bottle  i will however use any excuse to buy one  are they worth it  does the sleeve thing really keep the water chilled 
i  been really getting into painting my nails  however i only use vegan cruelty free and   or more free polish  i tend to post a picture of my nails after i   done painting them to show off the color but i  noticed recently a color street hun has been liking my posts  i just know eventually she   ask me if i want to try color street so i   doing my research ahead of time to turn her down  from what i  read color street is cruelty free  but a couple different sources say it isn   vegan while color street  website says it is  i also read from one site that color street nail polish strips have faint traces of toluene in them  which makes them not   free  but color street  website says they don   contain toluene  i   just confused  where can i find the correct information 
sorry if my grammar sucks english is my first language but i   really tired
what is the best stationary grinder with an integrated scale  looking at the oxo barista brain conical burr grinder but i   not sure if this is the best option or if this feature is worth it  should i just weigh the coffee prior to grinding  if so is the breville brebcg   bssxl smart grinder a good option the best option 
so i   curious   i  looked everywhere and i can   find any criteria on how people judge soda soft drinks  does anyone have any info on judging criteria  i mean i have my own system  but i was curious and when i looked was amazed with nil results 
https   www nintendo com games detail cruisn blast switch 
i   curious to see how it affects different people to me it  at around   or   pm
i have grown to love cold brew for many reasons  not least of which is that it  ready the second i wake up   i also love the smoother flavor but i feel like you don   get a lot of the subtle notes that certain high end roasts impart in hot coffee  by whatever method you ' re making it  
i feel like it  hard to tell the difference between fancy coffee and cheap stuff in cold brew so i  been leaning on lower end beans to avoid wasting money 
anybody else notice a similar phenomenon with cold brew 
hi all 
i brew with a chemex and like it a lot but a little confused about ratio  i know the general preference is a      but how do i weight it exactly  i measure out my beans and then grind  i wet the filter temper the chemex pour in the grind and tare the scale  now is it    times water including the weight of the grounds or should i lift up the filter  obviously water gets stuck in the filter so the actual coffee itself is less than    parts water  does the      consider this added weight to the grounds filter 
i hope what i   asking makes sense and isn   too moronic  thank you for the input 
hey guys 
i   trying to start a blog where i review various tea blends and have a couple questions on my target demographic  i  been advised to write all my blog posts like i   speaking to     certain people to maintain consistency  i  love some info on you guys 
i  love to know what age group you fall into profession gender hobbies experience with tea country state and something you  like to see in a tea blog 
i know its a lot of information but i  love some help on this one 
thanks guys

so i was looking forward to mario golf but decided i would wait for the reviews  granted i skimmed most of them but read enough to get the general idea  i didn   need a masterpiece  just a satisfying mario sports game like aces  i honestly wasn   worried about the amount of content  i just wanted a fun golf game  
but man the    average score is generous in my opinion  
i   not going to write a novel but there are a few key things i want to mention  and i want to preface this with  i am not a long time mario golf fan or even a big golf video game player in general so i don   have a lot to compare it to  
mario golf basically plays itself since there is no timing required for accurate shots and it shows the flag on the power meter  i land in tap in range     of the time because literally all you need to do is double tap b when the power hits the flag icon and you ' re guaranteed to land within     feet  
it  so visually unappealing  for something small with so little going on i expected this game to look amazing  for a nintendo game   but the visuals and art direction are awful  so boring  especially when you compare it to large open world games like breath of the wild and mario odyssey  
the course design and layouts are also super uninspired and boring  
adventure mode is horrendous and insanely tedious  
the controls are severely lacking  there is no way to pan overhead view  
i haven   touched any online modes of they exist so i don   have any opinion on that  
overall i   sorely disappointed  

does anyone have any recommendations for a satisfying arcade golf game  i don   want a sim  just something like mario golf but idk better

color street was a big one and others i  never heard of    i  been to tons of these and have never seen this before  heard them yelling at people why they aren   a pyramid scheme  trying to scam nerds now
this game is originally based on a movie called  flåklypa grand prix  that was released in norway in       it is a beloved movie for every norwegian but there  also an english translated version called  the pinchcliffe grand prix  
so this game is re make of a pc game based on the movie released in      and was incredibly popular for kids and adults  atleast in norway   now they  finally released a re make of the game and it  basicly a lot of mini games  end goal is to gather all parts you need to build the main car in the game  the game will be released on pc and switch on november the  th 
here  a teaser of the game  https   www youtube com watch v  vtuegfnwde
i am really looking forward to this one and i know for sure kids will love it 
i was afraid to pick this one up due to all of the bad reviews about the quality of the port but right now i   straight up addicted to pillars of eternity  no matter what i can   get it out of my mind  i am always excited to get back to it  the story the characters the side quests    it  all just so expertly done  i am actually loathing the day i actually beat it because then it will all be over  previously my game cocaine was disgaea   and i   guessing monster hunter  rise will replace pillars next week  how about you all 
so i decided to reinstall gta v after the cayo perico heist update but when i went to install it the blue screen saying  ' error '  pops up at     every time  i  tried multiple solutions like installing without internet and using other accounts but the result is always the same    
is there anything else i can do 
in a matter of minutes this sub has dispelled any and all guilt i have ever felt for genuinely enjoying soft drinks  you all rock  
i just moved into a new place and finally have my own office  there will be a desk and chair but i also have room for a console tv setup  
the room is too small for a sofa but a love seat would fit  however a couple of chairs might be even better

 st steep  after   rinses 
i  tried pu ' erh in a cafe before but it was terrible and i gave it to the others  this is the first one that i  made myself  i   new to gaiwans  my  th session actually  so i did what i  seen in youtube or reddit posts   did   flash rinses  tried the  nd one lol  and then    i   currently drinking my   th steep 
first   steeps  after the rinsing  were kinda weird and light   good flavors but   taste  but once the tea leaves got unstuck  no clue what  the real word  from the cake pieces  it is a   g sample     whole pieces with very little loose leaves  the taste joined the party  immediately the liquid became less watery and it was very surprising  i   a wine drinker so this felt     like syrah wine to me  if i didn   know what i   drinking i would  said that this is diluted syrah  and syrah is my favourite wine so    pretty enjoyable 
i was so scared to taste pu ' erh because of astringency and bitterness but it had none of these things  not even a little dryness   also people here told me that ripe pu ' erhs could be fishy   no fishy smells at all  or my nose is not working properly lol  
so between the  rd and  th steeps i had a blast drinking it but suddenly it lost all of its taste again and color after the    th steep   the color is lighter than the amber gaba oolong that i had yesterday  i   so disappointed again  i   currently steeping it for   th time    minutes    c  for   minutes  ok it  ready i will upload an image 
​
  th steep   g tea    c water   minutes brewing time 
is it normal to lose color taste and     ot fragrance at the  th steep  should i steep it for longer  this is  g tea    c water   minutes  i thought that the pu ' erh will remain stronger for a long time  the oolongs i had last days were pretty enjoyable at least for    steeps  the gui fei was really tasty for       steeps  and i had high expectations from a ripe pu ' erh  the description on the tea says    infusions     seconds for the last one  
is it normal  any tips  should i try to steep it for like    minutes   d
​
anyway i think that i enjoyed it a lot because it was sweet not bitter not astringent  not at all  and the fragrance reminded me of my favourite wine  syrah   i was disappointed by the watery taste after the    th steep but that  ok  i still had fun  i didn   expect to be blown away by          g ripe pu ' erh but i   so curious about pu ' erh now  i thought that i would not like it at all but it was definitely very enjoyable 
i want to try raw pu ' erh now  i will have free shipping from mei leaf soon and what cha is also free so i will order probably next month  if you think that these vendors are not the best vendors for pu ' erh i will consider buying from another vendor if the shipping cost is not too high 
so i   open to raw pu ' erh suggestions  not bitter or astringent if possible  i quite liked the fruitness of this one  it was like boiled dried berries with spices and a little sweet and not dry at all  but i know that raw pu ' erh is completely different thing  i think i entered a rabbit hole today and i will be broke soon lol 
pre ordered from ms store in australia on sept    the money  been taken out of my account but i still have the option to cancel have   shipping information or anything no idea where my console is 
i   wondering if i   better off cancelling at this point and trying my luck elsewhere 
we had an old pump well in the backyard  my dad hung a tin drinking cup with a long handle from the spigot  there has never been and i   afraid there never will be water as absolutely wonderful as that cold mountain well water in that tin cup on a hot summer day 
my little brother  series s won   play any games  we  tried restarting it  we have it fully up to date  anyone know how to fix this 
my oh my what a journey that took me on     hours clocked and i wish i could do it all over again  i haven   been this into a game in years in   weeks i have more time in this game than any other game i own on any device aside from microsoft flight simulator  my attention usually taps out at about       hours at most so to do    hours in a single player game straight through is unheard of and totally out of character for me  
i loved the story  i felt all of the emotions of the characters  and i loved the characters too  they felt like my actual friends  once i beat the final boss and rolled credits  the actual final credits  i was sad to see the game end  i haven   been this connected to a game in at least    years probably not since pokémon diamond  
and so begins the search for the next best game   
i was thinking about getting gta v but i dont really want to if i cant play gta v with my friends who still have the xbox one

i was playing hollow knight the past week and it worked well with just the d pad but gets a little difficult and you have to pay full attention  i   looking for a game similar to this but maybe a little less complicated  
any ideas for games on the e store that would be worth it 
i  love to see in      a new xbox dashboard design  the current one is very cluttered and i think the xbox team has the chops to come up with something new ad more functional  
have you seen any cool concepts 
i wasn   diagnosed with anything and the avengers never visited my hospital bed or whatever but i usually spend my time drinking lemonade  i hated water because it was so bland and i felt nothing drinking it  i  got a huge sweet tooth so    y ' know  but i stumbled across r waterni  as and just started drinking water  not only do i drink more water i just drink more in general and i wanted to thank you all for that 
this may be a lost cause as it has been a while since it went off the market and the fan remaster for pc is off itch io  even though i would still prefer the original on ps    since halloween is coming up i wanted to play p t  is there any way to play it  
not sure if this is allowed but i created the subreddit a year ago but it  a great subreddit to post about youtubers and influencers  from scandals updates and discussion and all social media platforms  you can join r vloggersupdates

i   looking at getting an xbox to play rock band     does the original xbox still suffer from red ring of death issues etc or should i get an s or e model for reliability 
was looking for something handheld to play pc games on but they are way more expensive than i  like  so my next option is to looking a something that is like a wireless screen to my pc with a controller  any options 
i received a chemex brew set for christmas and wondering a little bit about how much caffeine makes its way out of the grounds through the filter and into the cup     g       water grounds ratio  seems like a lot of grounds  the preground stuff im using at the moment  starbucks pike place  is measured to make a       cup pot of coffee but i know a lot of things could affect the caffeine content such as brew time and the filter itself  using     of this bag to make myself         ml of coffee with the chemex vs the   ish oz for the pot leaves me wondering approximately how much caffeine is in those         ml 
any ideas 
thanks
so the usb c specs are confirmed  usb c is the term i keep hearing about the switch  charging port  therefore here is a link where a google employee benson leung tested and reviewed each and almost every usb c cable on amazon  i understand quite a lot of us is going to drop big bucks on the nintendo switch so we should definitely pick up high quality cables instead of ones that might kill our switch  
http   www theverge com                   usb type c google engineer third party cables
this is the cable i bought tested and reviewed by benson 
https   www amazon com gp product b   vuqen  ref oh_aui_search_detailpage ie utf &psc  
performs great and is long braided and reasonably priced  i use it for my one plus two phone  
this third link brings us to his review history of all the products he tried and tested 
https   www amazon com gp profile amzn  account aflicgqrf brjgh rrd vgmb  za ie utf &ref_ cm_cr_rdp_pdp
edit  warning  i read some more of benson    or   star reviews and some usb c cables aren   able to withstand regular rapid charges  some cables actually damaged the product it was connected to  i suggest you guys read up on cables instead of purchasing any old cable 
that  all  i   sad for her  herbalife has got a real grip on cfs sufferers because of their easy to prepare shakes that they market as healthy when in reality they ' re like     sugar  i   tempted to outright ask her  how much profit do you see  i  heard mlm consultants usually barely break even  in order to not seem out the gate hateful but i think i   just ignore the comment entirely and quietly press  like  on anti mlm comments in the group 
i was looking for carbonated sugarcane juice  i can   seem to find such a product online 
while on the train this morning i put in my huawei usb c headphones into the usb c port expecting nothing to happen and     was  surprised when it recognized them  i don   know if this is known but yeah they work like a charm 
i like brisk ice tea and pepsi my two go to drinks  i just don   like water it doesn   taste good  i   sorry 
my brother plans on having a selection of nice sodas for everyone at his wedding and i was wondering if anyone has some recommendations on some good affordable gourmet sodas 
got my order from these guys yesterday and i had to sing their praises  i got the four coffee sampler and opened the package to find they included two extra coffee samples and a bag of cascara  coffee cherry tea  
i tried the cascara last night and it was great  sweet and fruity and really did taste like something between coffee and tea  this morning i brewed a mug of the costa rica finca el mango and it  outstanding  slightly sweet and acidic and overall just a super clear drinkable cup 
happy mug has been my go to  good coffee on a budget  choice for some time but i   definitely happy with the step up in quality for the extra couple bucks spent with s&w and will be ordering again 
disclaimer  i know this reads like  r hailcorporate but i am not a shill  just a happy customer spreading the word

i hate that the only way the watch tv or films on switch is buying them on youtube  in the uk we don   have bbc iplayer on switch or anything similar  this is why i   jealous of us switch users  i would love to have at least one streaming service on the console  it really makes the wii u more useful in the streaming content category than the switch which is sad to say 
what can i do best  does a water cooler  purifier help  or buy bottled water  thx
edit  i live in germany the tap water here normally is healthy 
i know there is little to no replay value i know how the story ends but i  never played it is it worth  also please recommend a good game for me on the store i   burnt out on my games rn 
this is happening on the lido e t i just used for the first time  wondering how i could fix this  
thanks
is there any benefit to them except being lighter than a heavy bottomed saucepan with the lid on 
how do they compare to air poppers 
can you achieve a good well developed light roast coffee   
any info much appreciated 
like many i have a wired     controller i use to game on my pc  this thing is ancient i  had it for as long as i can remember and it still works flawlessly except for one glaring issue that  recently come up  it has developed a bad connection in the cord and periodically disconnects depending on how it  moved  this in turn causes my usb hub to stroke out from time to time and my system will blue screen 
i decided to do some surgery and fix the issue and it was actually pretty successful but still disconnects on occasion 
i can hear you now   op just buy a new one  you ' re lucky it  lasted this long  
no  i refuse  this is the controller that  beaten countless games survived numerous drunken parties has been thorough thick and thin with me and is the only piece of gaming hardware i have kept for at least a decade  the console that it came with was replaced four times and now i don   even have a     but this controller still lives  i cannot will not let it die 
lucky me the wire isn   soldered onto the board  it  detachable as are the rumble motors interestingly enough  anyone know a good place online to source replacement parts 
my company has keurigs at work and are doing doing bulk orders now and i  yet to find one that tastes like mcdonalds 
we can get timothy green mountain coffee grove square and van houtte although i wouldn   be opposed to ordering some off say amazon if available to canada 
i enjoy sleepytime tea with a bit of honey and splash of milk before bed it grounds me and makes me feel good  i absolutely love the taste  is there a tea that tastes similar minus the calming sleepy effects  i   fairly new to the loose leaf tea game so i   learning  thank you 
i have a low end machine and i want to get the best possible out of it   however there is almost no control on this thing      
the portifilter isn   pressurised though but it just fits      g when full to the brim you cannot put any more in than that 
i am using fresh local beans roasted and grinded within a couple of days of delivery  these help immensely  i get this due to the fact i dont want to pay      to grind my beans myself      
i am somewhat of a coffee philistine  yes i drink instant still     but i just want to get the best drinks i can from what i have here 
i would like the end result to be as strong as possible like a real expresso  i was considering trying darker roast beans as i heard i might get better extraction that way

this is a cookworks expreso machine  uk model 

i use the email my xbox is connected to for a lot of stuff so i still want to keep it but is their a way i can transfer my xbox account to different email while still keeping the old email 
i just wanted to give a public thanks to  u suareasy for his generosity  he made a post last week offering a french press carafe and was kind enough to send it my way no strings attached

thank you again 
i live in minnesota and i   looking to buy about    bottles of leninade  does anyone know where i can find some  i  checked several places already but either they aren   in stock or you have to sell your right nut to get them shipped 
i  checked every setting imaginable and my headset is selected in every single one of them i  updated everything possibly related to it i have no idea what  happening 
edit  i  just disabled and enabled my mic in my pc sound settings and it  working again  hopefully it stays that way but ideas would be welcome regardless 
edit    yeah after    minutes or so it did it again until i disabled and re enabled it  no idea what  happening 
i am looking for tips on how to approach branching paths in metroidvania   what  your approach to them  i am playing salt and sanctuary and i find it pretty difficult on where to go every time  especially without a map   
i played hollow knight  and finished it  but i missed out on a lot and was so ‘tired '  of it to play for completion that i left it  i want to avoid that in the future 
a few years ago i had a  k monitor it was nice but i thought it looked about as good as     p with some good msaa  in addition to that i could get more consistent frame rates at     p 
this lead me to switching to a    hz monitor and initially i was loving it and i still am but recently i have noticed a new trend in pc games the only option is taa 
taa gets good enough performance but oh my does it lead to some weird and downright bad looking scenes on otherwise high settings  it particularly seems to struggle with hair  games like red dead   look awful in some cutscenes with  medium taa  and high still doesn   look great to me 
i just wish developers gave us the option to choose msaa more often 
would using adaptive v sync in online pve games like payday   left dead  borderlands killing floor etc  give me weird input connection lag like normal v sync does 
or do i just have to buy a new controller  i don   want to but i don   want to take it apart either
i teach high school  the other day i noticed that one of my students was drinking out of an herbalife bottle  since then i  also seen her with other herbalife merchandise  as a teacher i feel that it  my job to teach students critical thinking and how to be skeptical of things that sound too good to be true  
i doubt this student is selling anything herself  she  not    yet  so it  probably family  it  really disheartening to see my students and their families sucked into predatory schemes but i   also afraid of overstepping my bounds and potentially being reprimanded  
would it be appropriate for me to say anything about it to the student  if so how might i go about it  i  never personally known anyone involved in an mlm before 
i suppose this is an ongoing discussion and maybe the jury is still out but it  worth posing this question again with the specific request for actual user reports of factory oc  and non oc  variants from asus 
is there any evidence to suggest that asus is binning their oc editions  or are they just grabbing random cards from the stack testing to see if it hits oc edition minimums and slapping an oc label on them  the latter could technically be considered  binning  but what i   really interested in finding out is if they test all their gpus and reserve only those with the best results for their oc line 
i have a desktop that  has gigabyte ga   lmt s p motherboard and i was wanting to upgrade the video card to an nvidia so i can play mmo  and such  is it compatible  also the case is an cooler master haf    if that is relevant  thank you in advance  my budget is  k 
    my specs
    cpu  amd fx tm       quad core processor
    cpu speed      ghz
    video card  ati radeon hd      series

my comment on her post to a local but sell page begging people to buy from her pampered chef website  

hi  i don   know you but i hope you can reconsider joining pampered chef or at least get out while you ' re not in it too much  pampered chef is a widely known mlm which is a pyramid scheme        of people in mlms lose money in these  businesses   if you really want to support your family you will be better off finding another way to help your family  a mlm is not one of them  
i don   know you but i   coming from a place of concern  i don   want to come off as being a downer or trying to ruin your dreams but this venture won   be profitable for you  and will in fact put you in a worse financial position  please reconsider pursuing this path 

and i got blocked  i don   see anything wrong with what i posted but oh well  
you can lead a horse to water but can   make it drink  
why are people so invested in these mlm ideas 
for those of you lucky enough to have a career related to tea how  you get into it 
i   interested in trying to get a tea industry related job in the future specifically dealing with chinese tea  since i   fluent in chinese live in china etc    i plan on moving back to the states next year and i   trying to see what kinds of options are out there now  
thanks 
i   all for water and all but my dedication to water is not so outweighed by its resulting effect on the planet 
this was posted on a local selling group  these posts crop up a lot  but this one was particularly hun ish  i got all upset that she deleted her post before i could post my comment so i felt like sharing it here so it didn   go entirely to waste

my aunt and i will often drink tea after lunch when i visit  she  mentioned more than once a plum tea that her sister  no longer with us  bought her many years ago and how good it was  she doesn   remember the brand  apparently it came from some sort of order form or catalogue  i  tried a few times to find her plum tea but so far haven   found one that she says has a similarly strong plum flavor  for sure we  tried harney & sons mulled plum cider and that wasn   it  i   looking for suggestions you may have on teas that taste strongly of plum  thanks 
please help i need tips on drinking more water 
prepared to be destroyed by y ' all for that question lol  but just curious 
how could i keep a limited time soda from going flat if i wanted to keep it for like    years
hi guys so first of all let me tell you that i am completely new to brewing tea but nevertheless i wanted to try it out 
so i figured i  try to brew this sencha green tea i had at home  it  loose leaf and it had like rose buds and strawberry  and it looked very nice so i was pretty excited 
the first time i brew it it was very weak and it tasted kind of weird  i think i used too much water and i shouldn   have used tap water  
so second brewing i used more tea and after i seeped it it smelled heavenly  i was so happy   but unsurprisingly the tea was soooo bitter  i legit couldnt drink it  i used way too much tea and i think the water was too hot  i also think i let it steep for too long 
so third time  the charm right  nope  i used   grams of tea  one teaspoon  for   oz of water  water was at    f  i let it steep for around   minutes  and i was so sure it was going to taste good but sadly it was even worse than the first time  it literally tasted like water so i just squeezed some drops of lemon into it and now i have a weird hot lemonade 
​
am i doing something wrong  could it be the tea  i really just wanted some nice tea  please help 
a friend of mine offered me     for his og xbox one but he says the power supply burned should i take his offer and buy the power supply online where can i get a new one 
but hun if you ' re the boss and it  your business why don   you get to decide whether or not you close 
so i   not an xbox person but i am my father  go to person when it comes technology  he  in his late sixties and struggles w  setting things up   
recently he asked me to set up remote play for him which i did following a tutorial i found online  however he  not happy that his console turns on when he  using remote play  he insists that someone showed him a way to use remote play without needing his console turned on and wants me to fix it for him  
i can   figure out how to do it and all the tutorials i  found so far show the same set up i used  is that kind of set up even possible  if so could someone please explain how it  done  
any help would be greatly appreciated 
i was wondering if there was a noticeable difference with rtx settings on and off  i  been watching comparison videos every game except minecraft looks so similar between the two settings and it makes me wonder if the drastic frame hit you take in some games like metro exodus is worth it 
i   down to my last cup and can   find it in stores anymore 
so this may be a bit vague of a question but how is day z now  just for some context day z back maybe   or   years ago was the game i looked at & became convinced that i wanted to get a pc  now   years later with a pc day z leaving beta & steam sales just about to begin i   contemplating picking up the game but am a bit hesitant  how is the game  as smooth & alive as before  does the player base seem healthy  would you say to save my        dollars for something else  or is the experience within game today synonymous with the one i saw   years ago

i  been trying to find a decent variable temp kettle for a while and it  not that easy  i don   fancy paying     bucks for ekg which has a small capacity  i have a little flat and i just can   have   kettles on my table and    l  l is just a too small capacity for normal use aside from tea or coffee  also while goosenecks have their advantages i don   find the linear flow any useful in other kitchen applications 
there  a xiaomi smart kettle but it doesn   have any window to see how much water is in there and that  also something i  like to have 
i searched the sub before posting and saw that years ago kandi  line of adult toys was an mlm  looks like that is still the case   
well it looks like she has furthered her mlm empire    now she  running a makeup mlm  
she was one of my favorites on the show when i used to watch so i   pretty disappointed to have discovered this

recently i suspected that my gpu was not performing as well as it should and after a couple hours of research i realized i had initially installed some of the hardware in my computer incorrectly  if you  had any doubts about the power of your own gpu check out the free program gpu z  once installed open the program and check out this field and make sure your pci e bandwidth speeds are as fast as they should be  for example 
http   img techpowerup org        gpuz png
in this screenshot  not my computer  this person  card should be running at x   but instead is only going at x     times slower than normal   another way to double check this  for nvidia users  is to go into your nvidia control panel > help > system information and checking the pci e bandwidth speed there   for example 
http   users wfu edu yipcw atg  d sony vegaspro   images vegas    d nvidia control panel system_info   gif
my personal gpu is a gtx     and recently i checked these figures and instead of my speeds being at x     my native speed was only at x   the solution to fix this was an odd one  my motherboard only hosts three pci e slots  two     and one      i had my gtx     installed in one of those     slots  this was correct  and i had my sound card installed in the other     slot  this was the problem   for some reason when devices were installed in both     slots   the computer cut the bus interface bandwidth of both devices in half   almost as if the computer thought i was trying to run an sli setup 
the fix was to simply move my sound card from the     slot to the much smaller     slot and reboot  which free  up my remaining     slot   once this was done i checked in gpu z and nvidia  cp and my card bandwidth was at it  full potential  pci e     x    and it showed  my fps in games went up dramatically and everything was much better 
i know this post may seem elementary to some but i   hoping it at least saves a few people from the needless hours of research and frustration that i went through to find this solution   
it may seem bland and boring but occasionally a nice chilly water is the only thing that can satisfy your thirst  water can actually taste amazing when consumed infrequently and is even great for your health  so try to drink as much soda as possible so that the occasional water remains a treat  
this has been health tips with dr  ogden rannygazoo  
here  my splatnet battle history  after the game ended i bounced all the way to b   league time    the game itself was about   seconds long  we grabbed the rainmaker and dunked it right away  there was only one casualty  has this large a jump happened to anyone else 
so i used to have an xbox     about   year or so ago  now i feel nostalgic about it and especially the indie avatar games like laser tag and avatar farm online  i was wondering if the xbox one or xbox x still has these game modes or even the fact that you can make your own avatar  also games like happy wars and such i used to love them  which console is best for me if i want to play these games  is buying an xbox     still worth it now  or should i just go for xbox x series  what games based on my previous mentions could i play on the xbox x series 
i think tea is meant to be shared  i love sharing my tea with others who enjoy it and i love trying new teas 
after redditgifts announced its gift exchange for  r books i thought  r tea would be a great candidate for a similar project  we all love tea and i   sure most of us would love to try something new  tea should also be cheap to ship 
would others on  r tea be interested in doing a gift exchange here  the folks over at redditgifts have offered to help other subreddits to create their own gift exchanges 
we could also do it more simply by people replying to comments to pair themselves and trading addresses by pm  that way if people prefer certain types of tea  only herbal only chinese etc   they can pick a counterpart with similar interests 
we ' re a small community so just trying to gauge interest for this idea   
edit  sounds like there  a good level of support  i  contacted the mods to help make a decision between doing it through redditgifts or just pairing ourselves over reddit  will update with their response 
edit    received a response and the mods sound excited about this idea too  sounds like we ' re going with redditgifts  i   keep you posted with further developments 
i need tips man  i have a water bottle collection and all these things  i   trying to lose weight but seriously am not losing anything and i   sure my water intake has to do something about it

i would be primarily brewing them in a moka pot 
i mean consoles have a specific hardware and architectures where devs can squeeze every bit of juice the consoles have to offer  so why can   pc  do that  i mean we can leave all those different kinds of cpu  and gpu  for normies and or proffesional dudes  but then make a specific hardware for gaming pc so we dont have to worry about unoptimizations and lag as devs only got a single architecture to optimize for unlike nowadays where there are hundreds of cpus and gpus

just like stardew valley and yooka laylee should bloodstained  ritual of the night be cancelled for the nintendo wii u and instead be released on the nintendo switch  
given that bloodstained  ritual of the night will be released in      and that the unreal engine   runs poorly on the nintendo wii u just like stardew valley and yooka laylee should bloodstained  ritual of the night be cancelled for the nintendo wii u and instead be released on the nintendo switch  
releasing bloodstained  ritual of the night on a console that will be replaced by the next console for at least    months makes absolutely no sense

he should announce his plans soon because he will face more backlash if he waits until   months before release just like playtonic games

hey guys,
so i have a daystrike camo controller and it  only a few months old  for the past few days i  noticed it  acquired an upward drift in the right stick 
using the controller input detection tool in the xbox settings this is picked up as input  if i flick the stick it stops for a few seconds before coming back  if i gently blow into it or roll it around and click it repeatedly it stops    when it is stopped there  normal deadzone before the right stick input registers  then i start using it as normal again and the issue comes back after a few minutes 
does this sound like normal stick drift  has anyone had this same issue  any tips  i have gone as far with microsoft support as requesting a new controller  as it  under warranty  but i need to now send this one to microsoft first   which i   reluctant to do 
never drank it and when i do it feels like i   drinking acid and i get a sudden migraine  ama

for those who are unware f lux is a very popular computer application which    in an effort to help us sleep better    will automatically change the color of your device  screen to a hue that is a lot less offensive  
we as humans rely on sunlight to help us regulate our sleep cycles  awake during the day asleep at night  an issue arises with our various electronics and their emitting of blue light because the blue light messes with our ability to properly tell when it  day time or night time  this is why unlocking your phone in the middle night can really wake you up or why it  recommended by most  professionals  to shut off electronics well before bed time 
here  '  what the flux website says   f lux fixes this  it makes the color of your computer  display adapt to the time of day warm at night and like sunlight during the day 
it  even possible that you ' re staying up too late because of your computer  you could use f lux because it makes you sleep better 
anyway this technology is not proprietary    in fact ios and android have clone apps which do the same thing  i love my switch but can never play in bed or at night because i can   risk the unhealthy sleep meaning i typically opt for using my f lux enabled tablet instead   so my plea to nintendo is this  if you want to be truly family friendly making the device safer and allowing for better quality sleep    especially for children    should be taken seriously 
tl dr  please nintendo save our sleeping patterns and implement some sort of f lux service application  me need sleep good 
i travel for work and the switch is great when i   in the sky or on a train but when i   at a hotel i  like to be able to plug my switch into a tv  
i don   get the technical reason the switch requires the cradle as an intermediary  i should be able to output directly via the usb c port to hdmi with the proper cable  
is it just a proprietary reason by nintnedo 
i switched to p c in      after my xbox one broke  since then i have noticed games became much more easy  fps games are pretty obvious in mcc i went from struggling on normal to beating the collection on legendary  went from having a    kd in slayer to having a     one  i have also noticed it in third person games  i  been recently rebuying my old xbox library on pc and just beat sunset overdrive  which on console was very difficult when getting to late game challenges on pc every challenge is a cake walk  i noticed the same for sleeping dogs dishonored trilogy and gta iv v

is it bad to steam the tea leaves before brewing steeping it  for example if you have the breville tea maker the tea is in the container and the water boils first which would cause the pot to steam up and cause the tea to be steamed  does that affect the brewing process  if yes how 
sometimes you have to treat yourself  soda like alcohol or gasoline should only be consumed once a year  if you have a gambling addiction and are feeling lucky you can treat yourself to non water products once a month but that  only if you ' re feeling lucky

quick ignorant beachbody hun outrage  a girl i went to high school with just got married became a beachbody hun and   weeks ago had a baby  ever since she got pregnant she has been on a working mom shaming rampage through her instagram stories  unfortunately she has taken it a step further as of today to say that not only should moms be working this  opportunity  to  be stay at home moms working on their phones  in order  to be the selfless moms they are deep down  but that she would rather be homeless if it meant she didn   have to bring her son to daycare  homeless  she would rather put her son  health and life in danger living on the streets than take a conventional job to keep food on the table  if you haven   experienced homelessness don   put yourself hypothetically there  she  also stated that busy single moms shouldn   use being busy as a reason to not join because while her husband is at work all day she  feels like a single mom   no mention of the fact that she  living off her husband  income which is a giant strain on single moms that she doesn   have  again if you haven   experienced single mom life don   put yourself there hypothetically  honestly i   about to unfollow her because this entertaining theater of hers is getting downright agonizing to watch

long time lurker first time poster  a friend of a friend joined r f recently invited every one of her facebook friends to an event and i was called in to try and change her mind  i am familiar with a lot of mlms as my grandfather joins them constantly   sadly i was unable to dissuade her from leaving and she just kept saying  giving up is not an option  
all the same here was my attempt 
 hi [name]  as someone with a lot of experience with mlms i just wanted to put in a word of caution about r&f  while i know this may be hard to hear and the enthusiasm among sales reps is probably infectious the vast majority  over      of r&f reps will lose money while working for the company  rodan & fields like other mlms is little more than a thinly disguised pyramid scheme and as a result only a very small number of reps at the top are able to profit 
on top of this r&f  products are considered hazardous in the beauty community because they are not approved by the fda  r&f labels them as cosmetics to avoid regulation but many contain pharmacy grade medications with a wide variety of side effects  for example one major beauty youtuber now has droopy eyelid syndrome after using r&f  lash booster   i can link you this video if you are interested  
these dangerous side effects and lack of regulation are why r&f markets through an mlm model rather than selling their products in store like more reputable companies 
i strongly recommend that you jump ship before you run into financial or health disaster as many i know have while working for this company  i know you have probably already invested money to become a rep but trust me you want out as fast as possible 
real sales companies do not require sign up fees or monthly purchases to work for them and they do not recruit infinite numbers of salespeople into oversaturated markets  the reason that rodan operates this way is because the skin care regimen is not the product  reps are the product 
to summarize r&f is a scam and their products are not fda approved  while a small number of reps may make money most will lose money and some will suffer permanent skin damage  i would recommend avoiding at all costs  
i bought the acer a predator xb     hz     monitor recently to go with my xbox series x  i have recently noticed that when i go into my  k tv details in settings it shows that my tv setup doesn   support  k uhd at    hz  when i check the refresh rate number on my monitor it shows only   hz  i have tried using both the hdmi cable that came with the series x and one that came with the monitor plugged into both hdmi ports but it stays at   hz  does anyone know why this is 
i  been approached a few times now by total strangers  at the park and once by a neighbor  and they  been very friendly and weve struck up a conversation that seemed normal until they mention that they  been mentored by an older couple who make six figures and have financial independence etc  they talk about how this older couple mentored them and they are on track to their own financial freedom 
the first time little alarm bells went off the second and third time big alarm bells went off  they never pitched any specific product or company but i felt like they were sizing me up as a potential target 
is this a common thread among mlm scams or specific to one  or am i just being overly suspicious 
i played mw  with a dude awhile back his name was tyler and his gamertag was mw wv but he got off one day and never got back on  if you ' re out there i miss u dawg
deliverance from distraction   there must be a number of these   i only know of one at the moment a place called dinosaur on sunset in east hollywood   looking for more 
the model i   referring to is the simultaneous release of   versions of the game with slight difference in pokemon roster   story then a revised version a few years later 
while the revised version has kind of been dying out since gen v all pokemon games are still being dual releases  would they stop doing this for pokemon switch 
i mean the reason they stated why they  do this is because it encourages trading and social interactions which     well make perfect sense  however pokemon games themselves now have tons of incentive for doing this outside of version exclusive  pokemon that requires trading to evolve shiny hunting and trading perfect iv trading etc  version exclusivity isn   really that important for trading anymore  
also     well pokemon games were all handheld which are a bit cheaper than console games at     the price of a console game  now that pokemon goes full retail console price     well would they need to separate into   versions  
i showed my wife the info about the secret santa garbage and told her to be wary of it and to make sure she doesn   join it   she uses fb and i don

hi there,
wanted to know if now you can play zelda botw from start to finish using cemu with no problems 
also is there any way to play mario oddisey 
haven   seen anything about this one in particular so i thought i  share to warn people to be on the lookout for a more obscure mlm company called southwestern advantage  they set up some session in one conference room like it was a legitimate internship opportunity then tried to sell us all on selling textbooks door to door and not even ones required by schools textbooks specifically made by the company which are apparently full of misleading incorrect information and what correct info there is can be found in other texts actually approved by schools  they also informed us we  have to stay somewhere out of state far away to sell the books door to door likely to make it harder to back out and for some reason they kept saying it wasn   a door to door sales pitch despite that being exactly how you  sell the books  they also made sure to conveniently leave out the detail that you  have to buy the books from the company to sell them back the usual mlm bs of always mentioning the sales figures and never how much of that is profit  they even tried to make it a challenge to be overcome  o you have the integrity to make tons of money doing this '  sort of thing 
tl dr  it  not always the known mlms that can be troublesome never trust a company that won   tell you how much of your income is profit  make sure to ask if you have to buy products from a company to work for them if they say yes or try to avoid the question it  nearly certainly an mlm scheme 
so i wanted to play a game i didn   realize the disc was damaged i put it in an error occurred i tried to take it out i wouldn

i   winding up to buy a k plus and really prefer the brown colouring to the grey  i  heard tell that the grey is the ‘new '  version and brown is being phased out  does anyone know if this is just an aesthetic change  or would there be a technical reason to get the grey version instead 
sorry guys but i just bought juice today  it was      for   giant jugs of any flavor you choose just couldn   resist

so yesterday during browsing my library to start a new game i found that over the last year i got some games and didnt have a chance to play them at all and that i am really missing out on alot  i was late to the console era so not all new games 
so here is my epic games list that i have in order of what i see i would play first to last 
   final fantasy vii remake
   star wars jedi fallen order
   control ultimate edition
   resident evil ii remake
   uncharted    already played the first   
   red dead redemption  
   infamous second son
   kingdom hearts all in one
   dishonored    already played   
    batman arkham knight
    days gone

before the mods go deleting this i actually have spent some time googling my questions  but i   still uncertain on the answers i  seen elsewhere  
i understand that there are interrelated visual novels  steins gate and chaos head    i have played steins gate on vita  i  seen that there are other steins gate games that seem more like side stories  it  been a while since i played steins gate so i am a little murky on some details  
how necessary is it to play the other games  the robotics notes games are like half off on the us eshop so i   torn on whether to buy them or not  
i  also heard that there are issues that people have with localization translation  so i   concerned about that as well  
these look like they  be pretty good vns but i don   want to play them if i would have to play a ton of other vns on consoles i don   own  
i  appreciate some input on this  thanks 
i was being stupid was thought   what if i tried to download p t haha    after it had been taken down   i did that and now it constantly keeps trying to download it everyday at about   am  can somebody help me please thank you 
so my crazy ex smashed my fairly nice plasma tv when i tried to start moving things out of the house   i should have seen this coming because she has an awful habit of breaking only my things when she is upset   it  been a long time coming but i gotta get out of there and take the steps needed to get custody of my child until she can better control herself 
my ps  made it out unscathed and i   looking to start playing more in my free time while to keep my mind off of the daily stresses at night 
i know that i can use the vita for remote play but will it disable the ds  as a controller if i try and use it just for the screen   it might be a few months before i can spend upwards of   k to replace the tv but i don   want my ps  to collect dust in the mean time 
who knows what else will get destroyed when i try and move the rest of my belongings out of crazy  house 
edit   thanks for all the suggestions and replies   looking forward to making better choices in the future 
i have a mint condition  barely used  xbox     in the original box along with all its contents  i also have only a handful of games and the complete rock band kit  just looking for some advice on where i should look to post these for sale 
anybody had has one and knows what kind of card can still benefit from it  
edit  thank you very much for all your comments and helpful statements  i think i   pretty set 
avalanche studios '  mad max is one of my top ten favorite video games i  ever played and has filled a very specific niche in the game market & my personal unsatisfied mental itch  i  played the game to death on ps  when it was first released & now on pc via gog 
the closest i  gotten to finding a similar experience is project zomboid playing a vehicle focused character but vehicles make up a relatively small percentage of the games content in terms of mechanics & gameplay with no customization to speak of and has left me wanting more very desperately 
i   really looking for a  just a man and his custom four wheeled steed of steel death machine   type of experience  i really need a game with a very good vehicle customization system something that allows the player to create their own really unique combat cars 
i lost a good       hours of progress because my game crashed and i only saved once two days ago  it  on me for being so used to games with autosave systems that this kinda thing wouldn   normally bother me but losing that much headway was enough for me to put it down for a good while 
edit  i want to add that i do really like this game and i recommend downloading it if you haven    just don   make the same mistake i did 
now that it has been over a year since kickstarter launch i was curious about how people are finding the dock  there seems to be little to no discussion about it outside the ama which isn   helpful to discuss its actual use 

does it hold up durability wise when travelling 
is it still functional after a year of use 
any experiences with customer support 
any word on bricking 

i feel like given the barriers that xbox is trying to bring down between generations and even pc that having both r xbox and r xboxone runs counter to that vision   does anyone else think it should be consolidated to just r xbox 
edit   fixed autocorrect
here  what i  done so far 

set ai to minimum     
set steering sensitivity to minimum
set steering saturation to    

i recently with the above settings i practiced a rally for    minutes over and over and when i finally got a  clean  run  no crashing   offroading  i still got dead last place  considering the ai were set to the easiest possible i   just shocked at how hard this game is 
that being said i still have the starter rally car  mini cooper s  and i   not sure which stats to improve to make it easier  i   not sure which car i should be aiming for either if a better car would make the game easier 
any thoughts 
i  heard fry  has there own brand but im really trying to find barqs  i used to drink it all the time as a kid and haven   had it since  i would love to get ahold of some thank you

i just got into pour over and am slightly light on funds right now  i am looking for a burr grinder in the           range with a strong preference for the cheaper side  all recommendations are appreciated and in terms of grinders do you find there are diminishing returns as i progress into the higher prices  for example is a      grinder significantly less usable and reliable then a      or      generally  is the extra         worth the level of quality and durability that more expensive grinders provide  all thoughts are appreciated 
i can   sell my digital copy like i could my old floppy cdrom so is a purchase of a game really owning it or is it just a license to play

with the shut down of the wii shop channel approaching fast i begin to formulate many questions and so do many others  being that the digital game market is so large in today  world this event seems to be more important than many are making it out to be  no one was thinking about the future of the wii shop channel shutting down when it was first created so this leads me to my question  should we be worried about the future of the switch e shop potentially shutting down  will all the games we buy just be whisked away never to be downloaded again or will nintendo use the money from online to keep the switch e shop running longer 
lets talk about that

soo i got a teapot for christmas and i can brew tea leaves in it what type of leaves would be accessible for me and good for someone getting into it forgive me if this post doesn   make sense idk what im saying also i drink alot of green tea
so right around the beginning of summer sony was giving out netflix codes for ps  subscribers  i didn   use mine since i felt it would be pointless as my subscription was going to end in july due to not being able to play my ps  anytime soon and thus not having any reason to keep it up for the foreseeable future  yesterday i got an e mail from sony reminding me about the netflix code and i was able to create an account on netflix and redeem the code so it seems that even if you don   have ps  anymore you still get the   months of netflix though the code expires at the end of this month 
​
this may be obvious to most people but i thought that since my subscription ended i was no longer eligible for netflix  luckily that  not the case 
i think it    th of december when i last drank water 
​
to clarify i drink tea and nesquik  and soda but no water [obviously all these have water in them but they aren   water yk   ]
i just made  l of camomile tea but only just finished  l of water 
apparently your kidneys can only absorb  l water per hour 
want this  l now  what is the worst that could happen 
i  been in bars where i  had like  l of beer in a   hour period   and many friends could out drink me even  which i   sure is way worse 
so what gives    ps i   hammering the electrolytes and multivitamins   minerals 
i can   find a review on the game so can any of you guys give me your opinion on the game and the details  does it have a story  how far does it go into the dbz universe  what  the online like  i would just like as much info as possible  
i know i can look this up but i   just interested in r ps  opinion 
i   be doing a three week internship in washington d c  and am looking for great coffee shops to visit and try  any info helps 
i  been researching growing tea a little bit and i want to get started  what are some ways i can buy seeds starting kits that you guys recommend   
just discovered this by accident  it  not listed in the controls menu  if you hold l you can look at the current map for your region  if you double tap l it opens the full map with all zones marker support etc

hi 👋🏻 so i absolutely love teavana  golden monkey black tea drink it both hot and iced  but am looking for something comparable because the only seller i can find it from at this point is selling for about     ounce and i think the last time i ordered it it was about     ounce  i am a big black tea drinker and definitely open to trying other kinds but having a hard time figuring out where to start 🙈 hoping for some recommendations ☺️
all i wanted was to get a car wash vacuum  but no that  too much to ask for i guess  in the middle of paying the machine this employee showed up out of no where and started going off about how i should start my own business    because i have a van  or at least that  how he lead into it  all van drivers should be business owners i guess  four no  weren   good enough and the gate to drive through had already been up for a minute  he only stopped when i made an excuse and scooted forward 
no one goes to the carwash to get sucked into an mlm just let me wash my car in peace 
i   hoping to buy an electric kettle  preferably from amazon since i have a gift card but i   willing to look elsewhere   however for every one that i look at it seems like there  a bunch of one star reviews saying that it develops rust quickly the parts break easily and or it stops working entirely within a few months  i   planning to use it daily and i   mainly looking for one with temperature control  presets for different kinds of tea and also some insulation to prevent the outside from getting too hot would be nice too  do you guys have any recommendations‽ i   in the us by the way 
i   from uk and ordered the game as a gift from amazon but for some reason they  spent me the french version  
anyone know if theres an in game language selection    if so will i be able to change everything   menu text audio etc 
my coworker just showed me p t  i never knew about it when it came out so i didn   get to download it  everything i read says you can re download it but only if you downloaded it before it was removed by konami  is there any way for me to get this game  help 
someone bought me a    g bag of coffee for my birthday and it  probably the best i  ever tasted at home  so i looked it up and it was £    my first thought was  ' i could never buy that regularly '  but when you do the math each cup is only around £     not far off what you  pay in a coffee shop here  now personally i couldn   afford to buy three coffees a day from a shop but it puts it into perspective doesn   it 
not looking for soda stream but a but a full size dispenser 
looking for the best k cup brewer would rather not use keurig as i have   and they seem cheaply made  had anyone found one that actually works good and lasts 
normally i make coffee at moka pot but idk if it works for the tea i have here leave if i want to make tea in a moka pot i would have to use tea powder 
i understand the fact that you can play games on your mobile device that you would normally play on the console itself but is this just ~anywhere~  
like i don   have to be near the console to play the xbox games on the mobile device  i know you have to connect a bluetooth controlled to the device in order to play but i guess my main question is about the range 
has anyone downloaded and tried plex on series x  if so does it work well for you 
i would like to buy some essential oils specifically  i know they  been discussed here many times and but searching for that term isn   going to bring up the info i want  i figured it would be helpful both for shopping as well as for future anti mlm arguments if we had a one stop shop for alternative companies and products  thoughts 
i  spent many hours trying to determine a way to get a wireless headset connected to game audio with the elite   controller and xbox one console 
is there a way to do this  thanks 
hi guys i have an x  and am looking to get a second console   i am aware of some ps  and wii u games but i am more of an xbox guy so i   more familiar with x  exclusives   i also don   care about graphics so don   throw specs at me please   can you please send lists of aaa exclusives  halo   super smash rise of tomb raider  or like worthwhile remakes  gears ultimate rare replay    i   also concerned about the nx coming out this year  i would be happy in late         so if you have opinions on that please comment   thanks for your insight 
i  seen plenty of people disappointed and maybe even few who are furious that nintendo didn   announce a switch pro  me personally i think it  they ' re fault for believing rumors in the first place but that  not why i   here  i have an idea of why nintendo didn   make a switch pro but rather an incremental upgrade to the switch line of products  full disclosure i was smoking doing this so don   expect deep and complex arguments that are conspiracy grade good  
———
don   expect a company that  already dominating its own unique gaming market try to bleed into other markets rn  you can   play new fully packaged officially licensed mario or breath of the wild games and etc  that are fully supported and given official updates unless you buy a switch  not on mobile not on xbox piracy is wrong and it has its share of issues  going into higher performance gaming isn   nintendo  game anymore they did that before and dominated it in the   s but then xbox and sony broke into the market  so what did they do  what any company does and competes with them and they almost killed themselves  they struggled to find themselves in a world where they were slowly falling behind and going into the more portable gaming markets side of that nintendo knows  as the nintendo wii u came around thinks weren   looking so good  then came the switch and you obviously know how that went  fast forward to      and nintendo staying in the present market that xbox and sony so far haven   breaking waves into is a winning strategy enough  
first they added the switch lite a budget friendly console that was the entry for many unibody plastic body and no dock or detachable joycons  now they added the switch oled with a bigger brighter screen and a ethernet port with some more storage  a incremental upgrade to the switch while the switch lite is the entry original switch is the standard grade  
they don   need to increase manufacturing costs exponentially to be successful they added a oled and some minor features to evolve the console rather than do everything at once  doing it one by one incrementing like m  gen   abrams tanks to gen   or ak    to akm it  allow them to grow a market portfolio of nintendo consoles that xbox sony and pc can only dream of  a closed garden system similar in vein to iphones and ipads with games made for that same garden  they are playing a long game that completely kills video game generations and allows for a steady stream of people who will upgrade to the switch that best meets they ' re budget  
the switch lite being the iphone se of consoles  the original switch being the iphone     then this oled switch being the iphone   s max  they don   need to upgrade the power just yet because they control the only garden of its kind a console that plays nintendo games  just like apple music and apple news  being premium first party programs originally exclusive to apple products you would have to buy an iphone to access  nintendo is doing the same  until they have the need to upgrade the power to show even bigger nintendo games to show growth you won   be seeing switch pros for another   or   years just like we did with the switch lite and oled  it  a slow process  
but in the end nintendo wins by not having to fight a nuclear war like sony xbox and pc but a large tank battle that in comparison to nukes is smaller and less significant  but is in its own right a tough and brutal situation that requires more stringent use of resources and budgets and less care about total destruction but is it  own challenge of its own dangers  they win if they play it right rn throwing more power isn   gonna do anything tactically advantageous but add another front and it  own set of goals to accomplish  switch pros are not desperately needed to avert nintendo from total destruction  but a future tactic not yet needed at the moment  
——— 
idk if this makes much sense but this is my theory on why nintendo didn   announce a switch pro 
motion control doom is nice but i really want to play it on a gun con  so i googled around for a gun shaped rack like the wii ones but found nothing  
i would also welcome a gun joycon like the taikoo drum controller that taikoo released along with the game  a labo guncon would be nice too but the wait seems forever since there is no announcement on it 
tldr  how is there no  rd part shooter accessories already out for the switch  your thoughts guys  do you want one 
edit  solved thank you

any help is much appreciated,

been curious about trying it  i  done soda and oil infusions before using herbs and fruit but i  never tried pressure brewing tea  i wonder if i  just get the good stuff or if the high pressure would extract the tannins and bad tasting stuff too 
i  had my one x for a few years and i  noticed the last year or so it  getting slower and slower  i don   use it a lot but had a game of warzone on it today for the first time in    months  the guns weren   loading the buildings were so slow to pop in  not just this but the menu seemed slow 
is this what the console is like now  i do have a series x but this isn   a case of being used to that  its almost like it  being iphoned into going slow

first time posting and not apologies if this isn   the right place to post this as i see few other places i can do so  
simply put i   seeking to buy a set of lomonosov porcelain as a gift for the upcoming holiday season  the official site list   distributors   based out of canada and   in the united states as official distributors  although the certificates on one site seem to differ from the one issued by the russian manufactory  example from the official site vs example from an officially listed distributor stpgoods com  
what piqued my curiosity was that this site claims to be a factory direct distributor but not listed with ipm jsc  directly contacting the factory direct site they claim to be an official distributor since       has anyone purchased from these guys someone familiar with russian porcelain able to validate this claim  
thank you very much 
thinking of picking up a series s since they ' re available near me  i wanted to play the old splinter cells and mgs hd remake on it  are they available to buy and download on the series s  sorry i don   have access to the store and can   look  backwards compatibility is huge for me so i just wanted to be sure before buying  thanks in advance
last night i attended a good friend  wedding reception  knowing there would be a few huns in the crowd i thought about what to say in the inevitable confrontation  i didn   want draw attention to our conversation and knew i  have to bite my tongue  here  how it went after a couple minutes of small talk and catching up  
m hun  you know you could really increase your income selling monat 
me  yeah with a family and full time job free time is kinda scarce  
m hun  but it can totally be a side hustle 
me  thanks but i enjoy and find my job very fulfilling and want to solely focus on my current career  but i  love to try your products lies where can i buy the shampoo 
m hun  sighs well i guess you could be a customer 
me  yeah can i buy some 
m hun  why don   you just give it a try 
me  you mean shampoo or selling 
m hun  selling 
me  oh i   not christian either 
m hun  goes silent and changes subject
so the moral of the story if you need an escape just say you actually want shampoo and don   believe 
i   new to this subreddit and i just got a keurig and was wondering what you guys think the best coffee is available in k cups also i was wondering what you think about using the  my k cups  where you put your own ground coffee in  like folgers starbucks etc  
is l ' ange an mlm  or what is there connection to mlms  literally every top mlm woman i see is talking about l ' ange and getting promos on it
i am probably drinking     of all cups of tea i prepare lately very bad very very bad 
i  been trying to get my espresso game on  i  been a coffee enthusiast for a while now but my espresso have been less than spectacular  i cleaned my machine got better water a proper tamper  learned about extraction ratios and temperatures  got myself some coffee i considered good  preground i don   have an espresso grinder yet  and got to it  i  gotten some pretty uneven results from bad to decent  inconsistent and most shots end up under extracted and light   after honing my technique a bit and getting consistently bad results i thought about going to a trendy specialist coffee shop and trying a few properly made espressos  
to my surprise i didn   like any of them  the guy was pretty helpful and since it was a slow day he got me tasting a few varieties  i told him my main issue was about how i was finding my own shots way to acidic almost astringent  
he offered several varieties what he considered mildy to non acid at all  
sadly every single cup  i had six before heading home  tasted foul to me  while they had some great body good crema and a wonderful scent the taste was still acidic but not astringent  straight up citric  lemony  sourmix or unsweetened lemoncello like   i told him about this and he tried to convince me that coffee is an acquired taste and that maybe i was confusing bitter and sour  he kept pulling shots for me and the story repeated itself to the point that now i   wondering if maybe he just gave me six like shots just to see if i would even taste the difference  
in his defense the taste wasn   chemically acid acrid or astringent like if the machine was foul technique off or coffee bad     it was straight up citric with no other notes except a bit of honey or polen in a lighter roast  
is espresso supposed to taste like that 
i see a lot of discussions about how a rock can chip the burr break this and that but i  never in my life encountered something like that in my coffee   what is the liklihood of that happening  has anyone experienced it  if so when and what coffee 
hey how  it going  r ps    
i watched with interest over the years as the folding@home  f@h  distributed computing project had ps   working for it  having contributed various pc  of my own to the cause over the years i was quite impressed at what the ps  community could do and did do for f@h   see  http   en wikipedia org wiki folding@home#playstation_   
i have tweeted the f@h team about the likelihood of a redevelopedf@h client for ps  but have not received a reply as yet  so i  decided to ask the community here their thoughts on the matter  do you think a client can be expected  would you run it  did you run it on the ps  
i need a new headset and am looking at hyper x  i planned on buying the base base hyperx cloud stinger but i  heard the recent cloud stinger     is a sound upgrade  wanted to know if it  compatible with ps  since it seems to be primarily geared for pc and it  currently the same price as the regular stinger on amazon
i drink a gallon a day i pee a gallon a day   i am not kidding  i have measured it  like why does the body keep asking for water when it  just going to pee it all out  
okay so i made some stinging nettle tea i think i did everything right  cut the younger leaves and steeped them in boiling water for about   minutes  this is the first time i  made it and want to know if it  just me or if it tastes like beans 
i think i understand the basic difference between the three different methods  fixed refresh v sync  the original method  which can cause frame rate drops adaptive v sync which only activates when the frame rate goes above the monitor  refresh rate and gsync which is nvidia  version of adaptive v sync  however i   trying to work out what settings give the best consistent results in games  i hope this doesn   come across as a tech support post but instead as one that will hopefully be informative for everyone  i apologize though if this kind of post is forbidden 
i got a new laptop recently with a gtx    m that has  gb vram and gsync and i   hoping to play games with a smooth   fps and no screen tearing  which i hate   looking at the nvidia control panel there seems to be three settings to adjust in regards to v sync   monitor technology   with a choice between fixed refresh and gsync   triple buffering   on or off  and  v sync    on   off  or use the in game settings   i figured it best for games to have gsync functioning switch triple buffering off because maybe it interferes with gsync and have the v sync setting to on so as to make sure games are using gsync properly  i figured in the game settings themselves to turn any in game v sync settings off so as to make sure they didn   clash with the ncp 
this has worked quite well for some games  with frame rate sticking at   fps  but i  found some real oddities   
the talos principle  this has an in game  max frame rate   e g    fps   fps  setting that is separate to v sync options  funnily enough i found that even though the game was playing at a constant   fps  according to steam  in game counter  there was screen tearing  this is the same when you lower the max framerate to   fps  what fixed this was turning the triple buffering in the ncp to on  and i  kept it this way   so does triple buffering actually improve gsync  i thought they were completely separate technologies 
batman   arkham knight  even with the in game max framerate setting at   fps this game was running at around   fps and displaying screen tearing  weirdly what fixed it was going back to the ncp and adjusting the global settings to something else then setting them once again as gsync triple buffering on and v sync on  now the game stays at   fps  will i have to do this with every game 
the witness  this only has an in game on or off setting for v sync with no  max framerate  option  with the in game v sync option switched off my fps counter said the game was running at hundreds of frames per second but weirdly the game actually felt pretty sluggish  when i turned in game v sync on the fps counter stuck at    and everything felt smoother  so do some games '  v sync settings just act as a max frame rate limiter 
how are all these settings interacting  if gsync in the ncp is switched to on do in game v sync settings clash with it  or do the games work out that they should use gsync instead of their in game v sync while limiting the frame rate to no higher than   fps 
is there a universal rule of settings to apply so that all games will be   fps and no screen tearing  or does each game have its own different way of doing things  will i have to experiment with every game when i first try it out 
hopefully this post will lead to informative explanations so others can work out how to adjust their settings as well 
update edit  well it  a shame there doesn   seem to be a consensus in the answers  i guess that  just a frustration with the complexity of computer technology these days and the resulting anecdotal experiences  i think i  decided the way i   going to work is to stick with my three ncp settings being on  gsync technology triple buffering and v sync  and then in the games where the fps is showing as above     some are in the several hundreds   i   switch the in game v sync on as well which seems to cap it at   fps 
my childhood friend  we ' re almost    now  joined monat a year ago and has fully been sucked into the cult at this point  one of the things she loves saying to try drive her points home is  how do you know  how would you know anything about this business until you try it yourself  they   never get it until they try it themselves  
how do i get her to understand you don   have to try meth to know meth is bad  or that you don   have to join a cult to know a cult won   be good for you      like     i do not understand the logic 
i used to love playing rpgs mmos etc where you have to manage stats and skills and so on  but i   finding as i get older i don   have the patience for all of that anymore   playing xc  while is mostly fun i find trying to manage skills affinity charts blades etc a bit tedious   i   following the story while mostly ignoring side quests etc   it  working ok so far though i don   know if i would ever play it again   
on the other hand games that are too simple bored me too   i like metroidvanias for instance because they ' re simple enough but also have the some complexity in terms of gaining new skills along the way 
the problem is i love a game with a good story and that usually means an rpg   
has anyone else experience anything similar and if so what type of games do you still enjoy 

when booting up youtube on nintendo switch it brings up the red square with the white arrow logo and then the words  youtube  pop out from the side and then it takes only around a few seconds to load  in the wii u version it pops out a picture the old youtube logo in white with a red background in the backround a song can be heard playing and it takes a long time for it load  at least for me 
in the nintendo switch version of youtube it has thumbnail previews like in the pc versions and scrolls smoothly on the homepage and search  the wii u version does not have thumbnail previews and moving through the homepage or search looks quite choppy
in the wii u version of youtube you can swipe through videos with the touchscreen in the nintendo switch version however you cannot 
when searching for something on wii u it would just bring up the wii u  keyboard when i went to search something but on the nintendo switch version it now requires to got to click some little keyboard icon also the switch version has auto complete results to click on while the wii u doesn    
in the wii u version it takes much much longer to load up a channel then it does on nintendo switch

i just want to add that the wii u version is much more buggy 
if there are any differences i missed then let me know

i  seen a lot of people post about thrive since the anti mlm ban on tik tok and are saying the company does direct sales and not an mlm  i don   believe that  they probs have more of the characteristics of one   i  touched the products before and it was such a bad experience  my cousin also uses it and family and friends have told them many times to stop using it and go with stuff from the store  like i get it vitamins and supplements are a gamble but i would never trust thrive or any mlm supplement company as a whole 
i haven   played n   mario party since i was maybe a toddler and i figured since we now know all five boards coming with the game it  be a good time to see how people feel about the package  i was of the opinion when it was announced that five seemed a little low especially for what is essentially a remake but maybe if these truly are fan favorites they will be enough to hold it up  so to those who can recall old school mp do you think the devs really picked the best of the best

budget is pretty open but obviously i won   want spend extra money where i don   have to   if a       machine can do     of what a       machine can do for example   i  rather go with the       one  
what should i look at buying  
i want to play gta with a friend that unfortunately still has a     but i am unsure it if it possible 
this is the place to ask i  been wondering for a while and never knew this sub existed   i should of   anyways   i have a friend i went to hs with who suddenly last year started with the before & afters how great her life is    you all know   she adamantly defends it and says it is not an mlm   while sliding in my dm  of course  
i feel like i know the answer     but it  just as bad as the rest of them right 
hi,
i recently purchased a ps  pro  i   now looking into buying a vr headset to go along with it  but before i buy i wanted more information  there is still one question that remains unanswered to me  can you play non vr games and use the vr as your screen 
for example can i play final fantasy xv and use the vr headset as my screen   
i tried looking this up but can only find information about using ps videos with the vr system   
thanks in advance

has anyone else had this experience  whenever i go to a chain coffee shop  i know i know  and order a tea on my way to work i end up having this kind of conversation  
me  i   have an english breakfast tea with milk 
barista  one white tea  
me  no a black tea  
barista  but you want milk 
me  right 
barista  so a white tea 
me  no  
barista  i   confused  
me  i   asking for a black tea  white tea is something completely different  it  like green tea but with less processing and more antioxidants  
barista  oh    i don   think we have that 
me  i know you don   
barista  so what would you like instead  
me  an english breakfast tea with milk  
barista  so a white tea  
[edit  this post became a little more heated than i had expected  just to clarify this was intended as a  mostly  humorous post  i promise i   not really giving baristas lectures on tea  apologies to anyone who took offense to this]
today i am reviewing white tea  mini   gram coin of      redhead  
mini redhead is a single serving version of natural redhead  a pressed black tea from yunnan made in a dianhong style  made from large leaf varietal material the tea is sun dried with no machine processing involved  the tea is smooth with a very thick body and a soft natural fragrance 
the coin was   grams  
i love black tea so i couldn   wait to try it  
the dry tea smelled very faint  light sweet earthy ness 
the wet tea smelled like citrus and cedar  
   ml of water in a glazed clay giawan  the water was    degrees celsius and i added    seconds to each steep  
i steeped this tea about    times  it lasted very long  
since it was in coin form it took a while to break down and actually open up  
the first steep was a rinse to just get the broken leaves out  the second steep was for    seconds just trying to break down the coin  
the liquor i got from the second steep was very sweet and light  almost like sugar water  
by the  rd steep the coin started to break down and i tasted nice sweetness with a touch of orange flavor  
steeps      got more intense  super smooth black tea with hints of citrus fruits and sweetness on the back end  
as the steeps went on i started to taste this type of aged minerally sweetness that reminded me of aged      gongmei i have had and reviewed before  
the one commonality that this black tea and gongmei share is that they are both sun dried and aged since       perhaps mineral flavors develops from sun drying  i   not sure but it  interesting to think about   
the mouth feel was very smooth and saturated  
i didn   get any astringency or bitterness no matter how hard i pushed the tea  
the cha qi  energy of the tea  was very nice and i mostly felt a rushing in my head  during the later steeps i got a surge of energy that i used to clean my entire apartment lol  
this was a very nice black tea and i would recommend picking up two cakes of it  one for current drinking and one for further aging  
i find this black tea approachable for everyone

always remember to make time for tea,
stay golden

i   curious  where are the male huns  or maybe there  a word for them   i   pretty new to the community  
what  cracking my joints 
i recently fell in love with kingdom come  deliverance  excellent game loved the learning curve and the payoff of leveling up  attention to detail is magnificent and the combat is fantastic  
i was wondering if anyone knows anything else that would bring me joy  i am an old fan of elder scrolls but i cant get back into it with how simple it has become  also vortex for some reason gives me viruses every time i download a few mods from them  absolutely wack   
i  played for honor which has a similar ish combat vibe but i   such a newb entering an old playerbase that i get absolutely crushed each time  
any tips  all feedback is appreciated 
whenever i introduce the wii to someone we always play wii sports and it always goes over well  it  not a deep game of course but it  simple and fun  why doesn   nintendo create something similar for the switch  i   sure it wouldn   be tough to make  i   guessing the switch has similar motion control technology  i could see them selling a motion capture sports game for      of course it would be      and it being a huge hit 
i have a   oz s ' well bottle i got as a gift  love the size cause it  easy to carry  i might upgrade to a slighter bigger one cause i often run out of water while at the gym or running errands for a while  i wish it had a different texture so it didn   slip so much when i gripped it 
i  had the ps golds since december     months now  about two weeks ago the sound started to cut off every    seconds followed by a static noise  it would be silent for   seconds but the sound slowly fades back into the headset  once in a while there are  baby  cuts where the sound skips for half a second  there seems to be no interference around me and i   close as possible to the bluetooth usb  anybody who has experienced this as well can help  
any suggestions for a great café in washington d c   i   into single origin drip and pour overs  i   also be visiting with people who geek out far less  but would appreciate a really good cup   any suggestions are appreciated 
i have the ps plus and i have purchased a game i wonder what will happen if my ps plus ends can i re download the game or does it stay also is my proggress still there 
my mom is a huge hun  she is a rodan   fields consultant having started back in       no lexus earned  she has since joined two more mlms and swears by them  
the second one is sendoutcards  she pushes this onto real small business owners because she thinks it   make their businesses better   a handwritten note works just as well if not better 
her third one which infuriates me the most is new u life  she swears that this gel has reversed many people  ailments including her own  i am skeptical because there is no way hgh can be  homeopathic and topical   i swear it  just modern day snake oil that relies upon the placebo effect  
recently my mom has been talking so much about melaleuca  she bought products for me which i didn   think much of  then she started talking to her friends about this  wonderful opportunity  which translates to this business being an mlm  i checked on the  is this an mlm  tool and google  surly enough it is another one  
last night she was talking to a friend about how melaleuca is not an mlm because they focus more on sales than recruitment  in the process she pointed out the flaws of mlms that the ftc doesn   required the companies to record sales from each consultant and how most people fail  like i said mom started r f back in      and has barely made a profit  
it really upsets me that mlms do this type of thing  i don   talk to my mom about the harms of mlms because any criticism towards her businesses starts a fight  i   an adult living with my family saving to move out   i just needed to rant and tell people to help their vulnerable friends stay out of mlms 
hey there reddit community,
i dont know if this topic belongs in here but reddit never let me down and some of you guys helped me out a lot 
my situation 
i brought myself a ps  pro and i was struggling with the resolution  so my tv supports  k and my setting on de ps are      yuv     but the game is not running smooth  so the graphics are great and i can see a difference between the     p configuration  but the game still isnt running smooth 
is there any solution to this problem or is the pro this bad at  k   
would appreciate some advice 
thank you reddit community   
hi,
i   not sure if this is worth a whole post but i thought this would be a helpful community for some advice  my boyfriend is incredible we have a great relationship and he is really close with his family  his family also is so sweet to me and i genuinely love spending time with them  that  my preface  
bf  mom is heavily involved in juice   i knew this going in and at first i heard nothing about it from her so i was really thankful that she was respecting my own choices  however it started with her noticing me taking antacids and then getting really involved in my gut health  i do have a lot of gi problems and take avoiding my trigger foods seriously  she then gave me the shpeel on jp and how it apparently cured her other son  medical conditions  gave me some samples i took them out of curiosity but nothing amazing happened as expected  moving forward she started sending me webinars which i attended at first because she said they were on gut health and seemed to be unrelated to jp until the end of them when they suddenly started their pitches  i  since nicely declined these calls  
she then called me to ask about my interest in signing up for real  i told her it wasn   in my budget  she gave me a   month supply anyway because she felt it would help me  figuring it can   hurt i started taking them for about a month  i started to have severe abdominal pain some days and abnormal bloating  the response was that it  part of the  adjustment  but i make smoothies almost every day and have never experienced a reaction like that  
the other day she reached out about becoming a distributor or whatever it is to help neutralize my costs  she also wanted me to involve my friends and offered to have a call with all of us  trying to keep them out of it i told her that one is severely allergic to multiple ingredients in jp  the truth   she suggested that she could try them anyway   
it  starting to stress me out because i feel like she  not sensing my disinterest and deflections  every time she brings it up i try to nicely decline or change topics  i don   want to offend her or her career choice and i also don   want my bf to think i   looking down on his mom because he  so close with her  but i have always been anti mlm  i   not sure how to draw my boundaries in a way that  understood and taken well  has anyone here been in a similar situation and can offer some advice 
tl dr  bf  mom is super sweet but has been increasingly trying to get me involved in jp  how do i draw a line nicely to make it clear that not only am i totally uninterested but also anyone else in my life 
i   sorry for the long post any suggestions you might have would be greatly appreciated  honestly if anything it felt good to just write this out   
is there an open world game that you can go into abandoned buildings to search for supplies  like  the walking dead  or  colony    i did find a game    days to die  but it is minecraft like  i want more of a simulating survival game  you may also create your own colony or crew to fight against the enemies or just to survive and help people 
let me know and thank you 
this was an old very small sized bejeweled like arcade or stimulation puzzle game sorry don   know what this genre is exactly called  that i played on the early     s  it had a small tank that you had to run up and down in order to mine several small colorful diamonds  you could use explosives to clear ur way up too but it was limited and was very very interesting  every other levels were  even more and more challenging and puzzling  i had been looking for it forever but never could remember it  name so couldn   find it yet  if anyone knows what it  called plz let me know

how do ya   stay motivated to drink enough water  any tips would really be appreciated
right now it  not looking good for team red 
the fury x is on average  between       slower than a     ti 
it has frame stutter problems  it       and needs water to run at stock settings  it can only over clock roughly       mhz 
however  the same could be said for the     ti launch  the    x was crushed by the     ti  but now     years later    x has matured and the     ti reached stagnant driver optimization because nvidia more or less abandons  n    architecture in favor of development on current whereas amd tends to focus on driver maturity 
so what you  got is a    x that outperforms the     ti in most games and more or less equals it in all the others  and with amd recycling the gpu for the    x     you can bet the     twins will not leave their owners behind for the next  ~  years 
i don   know about most of you but for me even in my late     a     ~     gpu purchase is a significant investment for me and not something i can sustain on the same basis as i upgrade my phone 
amd seems to share that sentiment    so let  at least wait for driver maturity because i bet that will paint a different picture of the fury x 
update  i bought a physical copy  uk version  and i   having it sent to his home  thank you all for your help

i   looking for some insight experience  i found an info site while looking for deals on tea seven cups and they have a section about  how to infuse loose leaf tea    their suggestion was to warm the cup place loose leaf tea in  without infuser basket etc  pour hot water over and steep   when finished drinking leave a little of the infusion in the cup enough to cover the leafs so it  ready for the next infusion   i guess this makes sense if you are going to drink it fairly immediately right   or could you counter the amount of time it sits in the water with less loose leaf in the cup 
to wake up and drink some of the best liquid to a time where it is the best to enjoy
for years i  wake up everyday with rooibos tea and then finish my day with rooibos tea  during august  heat wave i only felt like drinking water so i didn   drink tea for a week or so  when i made my first cup of tea after that week i thought i  accidentally used a different flavor because i absolutely hated it  tried it again the next day and same thing happened  
i checked about a hundred times and it really is the exact same flavor i  drunk for years and i just can   drink it anymore  the smell alone makes me nauseous and the taste is even worse  i   not pregnant not on meds i don   smoke    i just don   get the sudden change of taste  i  looked it up on the internet and nothing really applies to me   
i know there  lots of other flavors but i enjoyed rooibos on a daily basis and now i just    can    it doesn   make sense to me  has anyone else experienced something similar  or answers to my rooibos mystery 
i know someone in paparazzi and ever so often they post something from the hun secrets manual that i   pretty sure they aren   supposed to share with the world  but lucky for us this hun does   
this time it  false engagement   emote on someone  posts to  help their algorithm   it seems huns are also seo experts now dontcha know  i also chuckle every time i see the term  papa sister  sounds like something vaguely incestuous

hey  first post and on mobile sorry if things end up being wonky  i just found out about this company zeal three days ago 
a housemate of mine has a friend that  a  ceo  and owns  several businesses   well roommate  friend rf to shorten things made a facebook live deal talking about how during these hard times we aren   getting enough stuff in our bodies basically  rf claims to have a product that has  all the vitamins all the minerals and all the super foods   rf kept talking about how you shouldn   spend two or three hundred dollars on vitamins when you can get all of them for     from him and about how you have to have as much as possible to survive the coronavirus  it seems to me that he  targeting older people too  rf kept talking about how when you ' re older you can   fight things off as well  rf said it  the best thing he  ever used  heard that before ended up with a house full of avon pamphlets soaps lotion perfumes and skinsosoft in the house for years mom couldn   even give it away  
she already sunk money into it on amazon before asking how to message on facebook 
she  like in her     maybe      i tried to tell her it sounded like a scam i should know my mom had to do similar things for avon  that was before the video  i started pulling out all the info i remembered about different health mlm   this is someone she  known for years and trusts i   a    year old that just moved in  is there anything i can do to help her before its to late 
i   currently trying to find a couch co op rpg game for my husband and i to play on our switch  it has to have decent camera angles good graphics and the characters must have an equal experience split  it is a must that it be a game we would both be able to play from beginning to end so no games that you have to complete a tutorial prior to opening multiplayer or one of the characters dies to where a single person completes the game  previous games we have played and highly enjoyed in older generations are baldur  gate  dark alliance ii and marvel ultimate alliance i which were played on the original xbox  my husband hates the camera angles in the sequels of marvel ultimate alliance  including iii   i  tried googling couch co op rpgs and that just makes my head spin

these drinks are turning up in uk supermarkets coming from the us  what is the most popular flavour and what should i avoid  they are quite expensive and i thought this would be the kind of place where people would know  thanks   
my brothers friend started  working  for them and he made a few sales very soon into the job  where  the catch to this  i know the quality of the knives themselves isn   the best but as far as the work goes what makes it worth it or not worth it

probably getting for a reveal soon 
something like what you see in this artwork 
edit  as many have pointed out the example in the pic i sent is probably far too drastic of a screen reduction for gameplay which i can   disagree with  
original post 
maybe it  just me but i can   stand the black bars on the side of the screen when playing a game in      but i also don   want to stretch the screen out where everything is too wide  i  always wished there was a border that would actually shrink the game down a good bit in order to create a sense of of a virtual retro room  as an option of course  i really don   need to see these older games blown up on on a big screen in front of me and i don   think it would be doing a disservice to shrink the gameplay part down to accomplish this as everything would still be highly viewable readable since games in that era were designed to be seen from further away on much smaller tvs 
i think it  be a fun way to capture even more nostalgia while playing these retro games and provide a different kind of immersion  and of course each era  nes snes & hopefully n    could each have their own  ' room '  border with appropriate era tv styles and posters on the wall   anyway just a thought  would anyone else appreciate something like this 
i have a somewhat unique situation and have a couple of questions  my account has xbox live and games which are shared with my significant other on her xbox using the  home xbox  or  game sharing  feature  we just upgraded to xbox series x  as i gifted her halo xbox series x  we want to be able to continue sharing halo infinite but my understanding is that the download comes off of her new halo series x  i   not      sure how the game is claimed so i was wondering how i might go about making sure the game is on my account so we can share it considering we need to share xbox live which is based off of my account  would i sign into the halo xbox series x console and claim the game on my account 
i   on the way to building my first gaming pc and trying to plan around a     p @ ultra experience  vram  important of course as most games i   seeing now require somewhere in the range of       gigs to run smoothly  
in researching the     ti  most are marketed as having  gb of vram despite the fact that when actual oc and overclocking is done the farthest some can reach is somewhere in the realm of not even   gb       mhz in the case of the evga hybrid for example and that  the highest    ti mem clock i  seen   
is there some marketing loophole that allows companies to market   when they ' re barely    or is there more to the benchmarks & oc charts than meets the eye  i know that gpu proper clocks can increase to above what  seen in afterburner for example in real game performance  does vram work the same way 
the wii u version had great graphics but the reach was too narrow not enough people was playing it  i sank so much time into mh   my second most played game      hrs first one was picross  d round   haha  now imagine having better graphics and a much more convenient system to recruit people for battle and chat during  fingers crossed   mh has to come on the switch right   
i was thinking about getting it but i have heard a lot of negative things

reusable specialty water bottles are cool and all but for general household use repurposing a bottle that would otherwise be used once and discarded is the best option  i occasionally can   resist a gatorade but i buy the   oz and reuse every bottle for water until it gets funky  at any given time i usually have six of them active two on the bedroom nightstand one at my desk one in the kitchen one or two on the back of the couch in the living room and one in the bathroom  these bottles are large easy to grip strong and have good caps  
they ' re also great if you know you ' re going to drink it while out and don   want to have to carry the empty around after   zero guilt tossing it in the recycling bin when it  already been used dozens of times more than it was meant to 
it  our night no one elses take back the night and hydrate   happy nye
i posted here previously after discovering she had gotten into an mlm and have since talked to her and tried to convince her to stop but i can   seem to get through to her  she  already been told by the cult that people will tell her to stop but she shouldn   listen to them  me   anyone have some advice  if it helps she  a hardcore trump supporter  
really two stories    
first up a follow up to the zyia hun from my high school  original story here  https   www reddit com r antimlm comments l rycy added_three_days_into_a_ziya_popup_party  
the party was supposed to end yesterday but apparently there were only two orders  more reminders about special deals and that she  going to extend the order deadling until tomorrow  i ended up clicking through to her page just to see how she was doing ratio of mlm to non mlm posts that kind of thing  with two exceptions  one about the inauguration and some photos of the full moon  the entire month of january is nothing but zyia posts  it was as if she and her upline had used elle beau  story as a model instead of as a cautionary tale   same     zyia huns commenting and liking everything uplines tagging her in posts commending their  teamies  for  rocking  their  small businesses   i just felt so sad for her   she  so nice and i can see where this is heading   
second up early in january i made a post in a local moms give and take group offering up a bunch of brand new tinker crates that my mom had forgotten to stop the subscription for  they were claimed almost immediately   so popular that the first mom who replied said she  take only half and leave the other half for the second person  i immediately edited the op with a disclaimed that everything was claimed  then a full day later a nuskin hun shows up and says she  interested so i sent her a nice message explaining that they were taken and then completely deleting the post to avoid further confusion    
i got a reply from her this morning     days later

someone get the smelling salts because i am shocked 
always important to make sure your pets have plenty of fresh clean water to enjoy just as much as you do  and make sure their bowls are cleaned regularly  you don   drink out of dirty cups neither should they  i like to fill a cup with water top off their bowls then chug the rest myself 
even more important with the hot summer months coming  
and pro cat tip  some cats don   like to drink from water bowls next to food bowls  it  an evolutionary trait  try moving that water bowl somewhere else and see if their intake increases 
i am unable to import stuff off amazon at the moment so my only options are those that i can buy in the uk that are from uk sellers  
mumba is more expensive but looks really protective and i can take my joycons out  i  heard the case is dockable but i will remove it for docked mode as i don   want the screen going close to the dock  i have got a screen protector on there but i really don   wan to spend any more money 
orzly is cheaper  but i can   take joycons out unless i take the case off  
any experience with either  sorry about posting too early haha 
i   a big fan of cold brewing my tea as i only ever drink iced tea  yes even in the winter  and sometimes even with the correct ice to water ratio my tea can end up weak when making cold tea the usual way  i  been wondering recently though how to go about cold brewing tea blends that have things like chocolate nibs or caramel bits in them that would normally be able to melt in the hot water  so y ' all think pouring some hot water in stirring to melt the meltables and then pouring in cold water and going about cold brewing would work  would it release the bitter notes cold brew avoided extracting  let me know if you  tried and found a way to go about this 😁
i  completed the b side to level   and   and after i grabbed the heart in both the game crashed  it still saved my progress fortunately  has this happened to anyone else  
i ran across a few bottles the other day and grabbed every one of them  it  a surpprisingly good offering for a corn syrup big label company and i   disappointed to hear they ended the production run 
has there ever been any word from pepsi why crystal hasn   gotten a more positive reception 
shame that they could have focused on improving the game overall but it seems as though development was held back due to the focus on getting it  to run albeit horribly on the ps  and xbox one 
with the game being delisted now on the ps store i  say all the effort leading to the release was basically put to waste 
the game would have been legendary as a pc exclusive 
my sister has been shilling young living for a while now and i haven   said anything to her  i didn   say anything when she promoted consuming essential oils  i didn   say anything when she promoted putting essential oils on babies  i didn   say anything when she posted a blend of oils in memory of      
but then covid    happened 
she posted on instagram how to make your own hand sanitizer with thieves oil  
i was going to let it slide  
she posted it once whatever  
but then she posted it again and i had enough  
i sent her a simple message telling her that you need at least     alcohol to be at least marginally effective and she is spreading misinformation  she replied with a picture showing me that it  thieves that kills the germs  well in my mind she just challenged a history major to a research off which is never a good idea  i sent her a couple of links debunking thieves as well as the fda letter to young living  
her response 
a very long message detailing that i was bullying her and that she was blocking me 
keep in mind there is a tense history here with my sister prior to this partially due to my parents divorcing and us having differing opinions about it  
 i e  i thought it was a good idea for them to get divorced because my mom was absolutely miserable my sister is super christian wife of the year and did not

i have heard of people adding milk to tea but milk is still primarily water and i believe it  added after steeping 
so i imagine that while the aromas are mostly extracted from hot water i imagine some nonpolar substances are being left in a tea bag  
some questions 

is this well known in the tea world 
is this intended 
are there any solutions either a nonpolar solvent or invention to extract these 

thank you
hiya everyone,
i got braces a few months ago and recently i decided i would like to continue drinking tea  i have been drinking white tea peppermint tea and camomile tea  i drink tea twice a day once in the morning and once in the night   
i   really worried about tea staining my teeth   are there any other teas that i could drink that would do minimal staining to my teeth whilst i have braces on 
my sister got caught up with rodan   fields at the beginning of the year and i  like to know some details about how they control their members  how cult like is it  how are they told to keep track of sales  how are they encouraged to lie to others & themselves  i will probably ask my sister some questions as well but i don   know how honest she would be with me unless i become a  hun  
update  between the time that i submitted this and the time it was posted i reached out to my sister  i asked her if she ever considered making her own products since that would probably be cheaper  she said she hadn   considered that and told me that she   try it  my mom  we have different moms  makes good money dyeing and selling yarn out of her kitchen and could probably give my sister some help setting up her own shop for whatever she makes  i   hopeful that planting this seed could push her in the right direction but i   still unsure about r&f  conditioning  if anyone could answer my questions above and maybe give me some advice going forward i would appreciate it

when looking for a controller for my windows    pc i stumbled upon the new xbox controller with the  ,  m usb c cable  however i have been searching for a while now but i can   for the life of me find what the other side of the usb c cable is  you can see that one side is usb c but litterally noone thought it might have been useful to show what the other side of the cable is 
could anyone who has bought the new xbox wireless controller with usb c cable tell me what kind of port the other side of the wire has 
this is a feature that should be easily accesible with the game paused at least 
thank you google 
supposedly they  changed the weight of the tests that use greater than   cores in their effective speed and gaming category and this benefits intel over amd since intel has in general fewer cores  userbenchmark claims that they don   receive any outside influence and that they are acting the best interest of their users  there is speculation in r amd that intel is paying userbenchmark to make these changes 
is this substantiated 
edit  this has been answered to my satisfaction  thank you for your responses  i think this is the best comment

i   enjoying some dong ding wulong here myself after having had qi lan and tie luo han wulong the past two days  nice to have some greener wulongs every now and then too 
thought it  be nice to have another thread like this  noticed there was another one a bit down  
okay first off i am not stating this to be true  i am asking  according to techpowerup com
the rtx      ti stock version has a      tflop gpu compared to the rx       xt     tflop gpu  according to techpowerup the rtx      ti is     percent more powerful  so for the tech people out there is the      xt  still using rdna   had a       tflop gpu how much more powerful would  the      ti be compared to it  the xbox series x is using rdna   which  is       percent more efficient compared to rdna    wouldn   logic  dictate that would mean the xbox series x is more powerful than the       ti

hey a few months ago i spoted a game in the ps store but now i can   remember its name

more infuriating than mind blowing but a commonly shared  statistic  is that     of women who make at least   figures do so through direct sales marketing aka mlms or pyramid schemes like mary kay amway and herbalife 
the actual statistic is that     of people who make at least   figures through mlms are women  there  only about     of them and they ' re all at the top of their respective pyramids but the first statistic is commonly used to try and entice new people into the company 
i work for a dental office at the front desk  my number one responsibility it  triaging patients who call in with issues such as a toothache broken tooth abscesses so on  i have to know and recommend doctor recommended temporary solutions 
i got a call from a mom saying her    year old daughter‘s tooth either chipped or had a filling fall out  going through my standard triage questions and she said there was mild pain when it happened so i asked if she was taking anything for the pain so i can note it for the doctor  she said   i have her putting thieves oil on it because it has clover and clover is good for the pain  
here is someone using an mlm in a way that is not meant for  now i have to gently encourage not using it nor using anything like orajel but instead to use approved ibuprofen and over the counter temporary filling in material only  somehow i doubt she listens me 
it  mind boggling they   trust a hun and mlm over a doctor

 edit  i   now broke and looking for a cabin in the mountains to complete this game list    thanks so much for the suggestions i should survive the blackout 
so i stumbled upon some posts on  r nootropics suggesting combining caffeine with l theanine for a clearer buzz with reduced negative effects  like heart rate blood pressure jitters etc   and decided to do some research 
having read a lot of studies using theanine i decided to try it and noticed a marked increase in mood and decrease in the aforementioned side effects when i took    mg theanine  purchased on amazon  
i  also found research showing that it reduces the harmful effects of alcohol on the liver and metabolizes it quicker i haven   tried this yet but i plan to  
here is one good article that explains how this works and cites a lot of good sources 
i thought this could make for a good discussion here on  r coffee since i was starting to think about adding theanine directly to my coffee to see how it worked and make delivery easier  do any of you guys have experience with theanine  any suggestions for making coffee with it 
being hydrated does a lot of things for me  one thing i noticed over the years is that if it  nighttime and i should be tired but i   not if i drink some water i can actually get to sleep or fall back asleep  it works pretty instantly too  why would that be  why would water make me sleepy at night and wakeful in the day 
once your information is sold provided or in some other way distributed to mlmers there  still protections for you 
since the mlm reps are selling a commercial product their emails about these products should be compliant with the can spam act meaning it needs to meet these guidelines 
   do not use deceptive or false header information  meaning your contact information must match the business you are promoting
   don   use deceptive subject lines 
   tell recipients where you are located  physical mailing address must be included  
   message must be clearly identified as an ad
   tell people how to opt out of receiving any further communication
   honor the opt out requests
each individual violation is subject to a fine of up to    ,     meaning if   of the above terms are violated in a single email that can result in an    ,    fine  
some may say it  a bit of a stretch to include mlm reps under the can spam act but at the heart of it they are promoting a commercial product in the hopes of making a profit  
disclaimer  i am not a lawyer or affiliated with legal practice in anyway  this post is from my interpretation of the law  i would not suggest flooding the ftc with complaints  but it might be worthwhile to flood to the corporate offices of the mlm with complaints about their reps digital marketing practices  
edit  please read all comments before attacking or reporting an email you have received  you are still better off filing a complaint with the main mlm company not the ftc

it  like nintendo took all the difficulty and stuck it in the final mystery house & champion  run  i   sure there is some champion  run cheese out there but that mystery house is all muscle memory there  no way around it  no check points either

okay so to preface this   i love platformers  and some of the ones i  enjoyed the most were metroidvanias so i do like to try games in that genre  i also like the exploration aspect and going back to places to get further were you previously couldn   progress  it  exciting  but recently after trying axiom verge which is said to be one of the best ones i realized that a very true to the genre game might not be my thing  i   happy for the people that enjoy it but i just don   seem to have the patience 
anyway i  stumbled upon gato roboto  for some reason i felt like it might not be as complex as axiom verge and my feeling was right  and i absolutely recommend this game  especially to people like me who kind of like nature of metroidvanias but not too much of it haha  so about the game 
you play as a cat that is sent out by its soldier scientist owner to fulfill the mission he can   anymore  i don   want to spoiler anything so i   leave it at that  what i can say though is that it has a lot of aspects that i particularly enjoy  it  challenging but very fair cute but also super stylish with it  monochromatic art style and really polished  the only negative thing i can say about this game is that the controls are a little floaty  you control either the cat or the cat in a mech suit  the latter is alright but the cat does often jump a little further than you want it to but it didn   cause an immense amount of frustration more just annoyances here and there  and also it does feel cat like so it is sort of excusable in that sense haha 
now about the metroidvania aspect that isn   as metroidvania y as for example axiom verge hollow knight  it definitely is and feels like a metroidvania but at no point did i get lost in this game  it does feel rather linear in that sense  and that  something i appreciate  don   get me wrong it is fun to sometimes try all these rooms on a map that are still marked as unexplored and see which one will be the way to progress now that you got your shiny new double jump dash destroy certain things whatever ability but games with a heavy focus on it often left me feeling frustrated  this game didn   do that  again if you enjoy it more power to you  but i want to recommend this game to light metroidvania lovers platformer fans retro pixel art appreciaters  it is really well done it  cute the gameplay is super solid the presentation is very polished and it  just an all around enjoyable time 
i don   see this game mentioned on this sub very often  if at all there  no instance i can think of right now  and i   sure people would really enjoy it  so yeah if this little write up sparked your interest definitely check it out i wholeheartedly recommend it and hope that maybe i was able to tell you about a game you didn   really know about before and might like  thank you for reading 
i am trying to sign up to the teachat com forum because i think they might have the best puerh community online  correct me if i am wrong 
anyway after completing the signup form i got a  welcome  message but the account hasn   been activated  i sent an inquiry after   days but no reply 
there might just be a chance of a teachat com admin here as this is probably one of the few places where one can discuss tea  
thank you 
edit  i just spotted the teachat com link in the sidebar   so it would seem they got recognition from us 
if anyone is looking for something similar to the p t  demo check out lurk in the dark on steam  it is just a demo made by one person and the first full episode is supposed to come at the end of      early       it does have a poor english translation in certain parts and i hope that is fixed when it hits early access 
if there are giant floods than us fellow hydro homies can just drink our way out of trouble 
so i recently got a newer keurig coffee maker for my birthday and for some reason every cup of coffee tastes horrible  it  normally way too strong and i guess bitter  it  just nasty  i  tried putting in less grounds but to no avail 
i don   use k cups because they ' re all way too expensive  i have the plastic cups you can fill with your choice of grounds and i  tried random coffees from maxwell folgers to starbucks and some obscure brands 
i don   know what the problem is  i just want a nice cup of coffee

it  ridiculous you have to pay     for a bottle of soda because companies are buying out all the inventory  where can i buy this soda for cheap online and they ship to the us 
i got a bottle of moisturizer and sunscreen in a mother  day box  i  never used it and it says for sensitive skin  is it worth it to keep or should i just donate it  or is it straight trash 
i accidentally drank double the amount of water i   supposed to today  i was super bored 
i want to buy black tea with all the chai spices already in it   i know i know you can make your own but i   lazy  
if not chai i want other wintery spice mixes  stuff that  heavy in cinnamon sweet orange all spice etc  
any recommendations  
edit  so many yummy recommendations   i   going to buy pretty much all of them and give out the best ones as christmas presents i think  you guys are awesome    
the rewards come from twitch prime but if you don   have that you can do what i said and you will get the rewards anyway  
hardly any community  hardly any matches or if they are they ' re one sweaty player who owns you because you can   get any matches to get better in 
no wonder i turned out to be the hydrohomie i am  i just got off the phone with my mama and as always she signs off with 
 alright hun drunk lots of water i love you  
not all is perfect but that is just exactly right 
i want that sweet filtered goodness but i   the only one that puts in the work  i wanna teach the house a lesson but then i   not have filtered water for myself 
i had no idea how many essential oils were from mlms  doterra young living etc   always thought they were sketchy and weird how enthusiastically people supported them but just recently learned that these brands are mlms  
so the question is    did mlms make essential oils a thing  are there any non mlm essential oils brands  or is it all just a giant scam 
i   thinking of making a move out to philly in a month or so  what shops do you like out there  who  doing it well who  not worth the hype and is anyone hiring 
if i add a tiny shot of lemon juice to my water

imagine just playing it casually around the house and outside it  the perfect game for this  since you have turns you could make sandwitch while playing the game for example  if you  have the switch on your counter or something 
it  a great game for this because it doesn   need constant attention and there  no rush  and since you can take in anywhere one more turn is even more appealing lol 
fyi i   just a guy who  love civilzation on switch this isn   an e  leak or anything  d

after over a year of contemplating researching testing i   finally going to move forward and launch my tea company  i   in the process of finalizing agreements with wholesale tea accounts and putting my site up 
what would you like to see in an online tea company  what  the most important thing when you ' re buying tea online  is the monthly subscription model something that interests you  any wholesale tea companies that i should look into 
once i launch i   be giving redditors promos  not sure how much yet  
any help would be greatly immensely appreciated

hi there i   currently searching for good at home espresso latte machines but i   brand new to this  advice and suggestions would be really great  thanks 
is anyone else getting really bad framerates when a lot is going on  doesn   help that the game is capped to   fps even on the enchanced console but at times frames render extremely slow and cause the gameplay to suffer 
yesterday we went to a latino heritage party there were several stalls with food and drinks my oldest daughter saw one where they made bubble tea as she likes it she asked me for money to buy one it cost    dollars which seemed expensive but i thought it was a party and people want to make money when she brought that tea i tried it it had a synthetic flavor and i saw the label that said main nutrition i went to google and looked for information i felt really bad it was a herbalife store 🤣🤣🤣
for me it  battlefield    
i love the battlefield franchise but bf v is just awful and unfortunately bf  was never consumer friendly enough to keep servers alive  the rental servers suck basically   battlefield   just has everything i could want in a shooter and more and nothing new has come close    
this notion has me curious though what are some games that you guys can   seem to shake  which pc games do you guys always go back to 
listen here 
if you drink water you are not thirsty 
if you are not thirsty 
you don   drink water 
when you don   drink water 
you get thirsty 
if you get thirsty 
you drink all the water 
then there is no more water 
when there is no more water 
you take water from your friends 
then your friends don   have water 
when your friends don   have water 
your friends die 
when your friends die 
you have no friends for water 
then you steel from others 
if you steel 
you have to run 
if you have to run 
you get tired 
if you get tired 
you get caught 
if you get caught 
you go to prison 
then you can   go outside 
if you can   go outside 
you get bored 
if you get bored 
you escape 
when you escape 
you get tired again 
then you are caught
then you escape again 
then the police pull out guns 
if the police pull out guns 
they shoot you 
if they shoot you 
you die 
if you die 
you are dead 
so don   drink water

trying to get the wife into gaming  she seems willing but just isn   very good at them   yet  we played street fighter ii on our second date many moons ago and i annihilated and possibly scarred her  i could not help it  somehow we worked out   any suggestions for ps  games with great but simple co op for a newer gamer 
about   months ago i ordered a fruit tea sampler pack from adagio com but i found out that fruit tea is just not my thing  so i  like to give my remaining samplers to a fellow redditor in the city  just pm me and i   hand it to you somewhere in the city and we can have a brief conversation about tea 
hi there recently i bought ps  pro for gaming  i saw a lot of peoples are do live in facebook groups  directly 
can anyone to tell me how they do that from ps    thanks best regards 
the only one i seem to find are other countries or from a long time ago and just aren   available anymore  figured there should be at least one somewhere seems weird to me
i can   believe i didn   think about this sooner 
so for a long time the biggest drawback with my hario grinder has been that the steps are too large  i can pull a shot where it takes    seconds start to finish knock the grind size down a step and then it takes a minute and a half  part of this is that the grinder isn   really the best grinder for espresso and it could do with grinding a bit more evenly  however i should ideally be able to make finer grind adjustments than that right 
so i had an idea to ditch the included adjustment nut and instead use a regular nut and a washer  you ' re looking specifically for an m  fender washer  to cover protect the stock adjustment nubs  and an m x    nylock nut  nylon insert lock nut   this will ensure that the adjustment nut doesn   move around during grinding 
i removed the factory adjustment nut and replaced it with the washer first followed by the nut  you will likely need a wrench or pliers to spin the adjustment nut once the nylon engages with the threads on the axle  i also made some marks on the nut and the burr holder to act as guides for how much to adjust  
et voilà   infinitely variable grind adjustment on the cheap  it doesn   really fix the unevenness but at least you can get the base grind setting dialled in better  i found that one full turn out from gently seated was a good starting point for my flair probably a couple of flats less for a pump espresso maker with a full size basket 
cons  you need a wrench to make grind adjustments with this  there just isn   any way for the nut to stay in place without it being too stiff otherwise  if you can happen to find a nylock wing nut in the appropriate size you might be able to still adjust the grind by hand 
my friend got added by this person and she has over a million gamerscore and her follower count is going up very fast  i found her twitter when i went digging but it  all nsfw videos and i think her main xbox account is ms kyu and her alternate is  paste  she has added several people in the last week and it  says she has no friends  if someone could tell me if this person is trying to get my friend to follow her for publicity or if she  a bot 
because i just ate a whole burger king menu and a half myself with a full crisp entire litre of water 
when i rebuilt my database on my ps  one of my games that i bought of the ps store was gone from my main menu library and i went on my laptop and found it on the purchased section i tried to re download it but it is not allowing me to  
any suggestions on how to fix this 
ok so adaptive sync has finally become widely available in      
i am looking for subjective opinions on how worth while it is and how you value it compared to other modern features like wide screen ips panels     p or    hz 
its been multiple years of playing console but after all the people i  met friends i  made and games i  played i   finally switching  i honestly cant believe i actually might be doing it soon  i have spent so much time over the years watching people who play on the coolest looking and smoothest playing pcs out there  but now i get to experience it in person  i have been playing on a laptop for most my games for around year now and now i feel like i want to get a upgrade  i   still doing research on pcs prebuilt or custom built  since i   fairly new to the market so i   going to get a prebuilt but even then there  way to many options  i hope that i   be able to meet some new people on pc and play some cool games  peace   
can someone please point me to the right direction

ummm so i am to coffee idk if it even makes sense but i really wanna know how to make americano without a coffee machine
ok so i had gta   pe since      and i was hoping to play today but for some reason it wasnt in my library  so i checked my order history on my xbox and gta v wasnt there but the premium edition was there which is weird because i brought a gta v code from gamestop that gives me the full gta v full game and the premium edition  i also checked my order history and the microsoft website and gta v was there with the premium edition was there and it said it was prepaid because for sure i got the code of it from gamestop 
yea ofc i played it before  i vividly remembered being level     last time i played  gta v itself was removed from my library but the premium edition dlc was still there so it seems microsoft or xbox removed the game from my library 
i already tried looking around on xbox support but i couldn   find where they can help with a game being removed from my library  
if anyone can help  please let me know
does anyone know of anywhere selling it via bottle can or fountain in the orlando area if at all  thanks

hey guys 
i   wondering if i should pick up this coffee  http   www klatchroasting com ka_u_typica_p haw_kau_typ htm
it  quite expensive so i figured i would ask here if anyone has had it yet or previous years  wanting to know if it  worth the     price tag thanks 
oh and gameplay would be nice too but if it  not my type of game i  still look into it and keeping it as sealed ps  ps  games
i noticed because my local kroger variants suddenly stopped selling shasta and at the same time they had a similar line under their big k name   
if they did i  love to see the return of diet tiki punch   i forgot the kroger name because they don   have it in diet either   buy yay diet black cherry 
everyone says it has a super complex flavor but to me it just tasted like cinnamon  did anyone else try it and felt like it didn   live up to the hype 
i can   seem to find any data online so i   not sure if this data even exists  would it be fair to say a majority of mlm reps are faith based or follow some form of religion  if you take even half of reported distributors for some of the mlms that promote religion heavily amway,mk,  ,etc  it would equal half of the dsa  report that there is a total of      million distributors combined 
this is just a small sample  dreading but also morbidly excited for this party on sunday that i have to go to   i   give y ' all the deets if i come out alive  
note the   unanswered questions one of which asking what the start up cost is  dare i say she answered in a   pm 😱
i   getting error code ce         when trying to install a game  the code says the game is already installed but it is not as far as i can tell  i have 
 checked for the game in both the system storage and my external storage in system settings
 checked for the game under  library 
 checked for record of the game under downloads
 checked for game save data in system storage
 deactivated and reactivated as primary console
 restored licenses
 defragged the ps   rebuilt database 
​
none of these things seem to work and when i try to download the game either from the ps store or from my  downloads  in the library i receive the error code  does anyone know a fix for this 
not sick yet and it  been a few days so that  a win
i love stealth games and curious to see if maybe i  missed a hidden gem 
i made a thread about losing sense of smell due to covid awhile ago back in      when i was originally infected and i   happy to say that over the last month i   finally starting to be able to piece together the notes of coffee once again 
covid caused me to develop anosmia for a few weeks while infected but even after that left me with paranosmia   my brain interpreted smells in a way that was different compared to how it did previously 
because of this for basically the last year coffee has basically smelled and tasted like weak instant coffee no matter the roast or grind or brewing method  freshly ground beans just smelled like the way used damp pourover grinds used to smell 
a year and two vaccinations later and coffee is coming back finally  as of right now the main note i   getting from coffee is peanut but i   take peanut over nothing any day 
just thought i  make this post in case any other coffee lovers lost their smell and didn   see it recover in a couple months   apparently it can still come back after a year    
so i tried going onto the e shop and it  currently down for maintenance  does this mean the vc is coming soon  just speculation   
edit  e shop is back up with the addition of a  best seller  menu

what are my homies thoughts and opinions  blasphemy  heresy  or am i onto something here  
you can drink too much water and for water enthusiasts like us it  not actually that hard  i don   have a set point for how much is too much but basically you want to give yourself time to pee it out  the problem is that when you drink too much water the electrolytes in your blood are diluted  i   not sure but i believe this can still be a problem with electrolyte infused waters because our body has a delicate balance of electrolytes it strives to maintain that is being interferes with  if you want to read up more about this look up hyponatremia   low blood sodium  the solution is to drink water throughout your day instead of all at once  one of the initial symptoms of electrolyte imbalance from over hydration is a headache  you can die from this but that relates to how much water you drank and how fast

by the way if you ' re tired of paying income taxes join an mlm  you don   have to pay income tax if your income is negative   s 
which one of these would be overall the best  ease of use would probably be my most important deciding factor since the grind quality is supposed to be pretty much equal i think 
​
i placed an order for the lido e  a bit cheaper than the c   better for espresso and supposedly easier grinding due to bigger burrs  but i stumbled upon the m   traveller  regular is too expensive for me  just now and i   doubting my decision 
need a new grinder any recommendations would be appreciated  usually brew chemex or aeropress but i have been considering getting a flair for espresso soon but need a better grinder

the sheer number of games that have appeared from  st party ip  has led to an enormous number of awards and praise for the route nintendo has taken with revolutionizing botw and super mario odyssey  however one studio that hasn   been heard from in a while is nintendo  own retro studios the very creators of the famous metroid prime series  it has been over   years since retro  last game so what could they have cooked up in all this time  that  what i want to ask the community about on what they want from retro  so what would be the best choice from these options on what retro would likely come out with  possibly at e     
   new donkey kong country game 
  new ip  m rated or for everyone  
  next f zero

i don   really need anything fancy  no bigger than a half gallon ideally 
my convoluted plan is to use a smart plug to turn on a baratza encore for a specific amount of time each morning  the encore will be placed above a programmable coffee maker and grounds will be gravity fed into it with the aide of a chute 
i feel like doc brown from back to the future but as far as i can tell this rube goldberg setup is the most cost effective and convenient way to wake up to a good cup of coffee with zero early morning effort 
i could get a coffee maker with a built in grinder but the coffee is subpar from what i  heard and cleaning the machines is typically very involved  grinding the night before sacrifices freshness and having to do it in the morning isn   that big of a deal but that  no fun 
will my stupid scheme work  what coffee maker might accommodate this 
hi hope this is okay to post let me know if not 
my aunt started selling scentsy about   months ago  i didn   really pay too much attention initially although i did say to my uncle ‘isn   that kind of a pyramid scheme  '  and he was a bit snippy and said no she was starting her own business  i later found out she was brought on by a friend who has been doing it for several years and is a ‘director '   
i then read more about it watched a great bbc doc on mlms and now a couple of days ago she has posted that she is looking to build her team  i feel really nervous and uncomfortable about it all they are both so bought in as are some of her family members about supporting her  if she is just doing it because she enjoys it and only selling to people who actually want to buy it then whilst it is making money for a horribly unethical company at least she isn   hurting others 
but now she is looking to recruit   it just leaves me with a bad taste  how can i talk to them about it in a way which might get past all the company rhetoric and their defensiveness  any examples of what has worked for others 
i   pretty close to them and don   want to cause issues with our relationship  i suspect they will be defensive because of the rubbish that the scentsy leadership promote and because they see it as her starting her own business which it isn    especially at the moment it seems awful that she may recruit others under the promise of making money who likely won    
really appreciate any help 
experimenting with replacing my morning coffee with green tea  weird thing is just one cup of tea makes me feel anxious and jittery  i can drink multiple cups of coffee and not feel like this  anyone know why this would be 
im struggling with the urge to buy more coffee drippers   i keep telling myself that i don   need many of them and maybe should try more recipes with the same dripper and practice more  
can i justify adding them for different recipes  or is a regular v   good enough for     method  i   particular interested in this approach because i like sweet tastes 
i   thinking to add tetsu kasuya version of v   for     method and maybe origami dripper just because it looks good 
edit  after reading so many ppl recommending aeropress i just ordered one from amazon  thank you all  looking forward to play around it 
the nvme m   port has a higher read speed than conventional sata ssds  if you by a m   that has a speed higher than a ssd you will notice this just during the transference of files and things like that games are not optmimized to that speed is not hard to find m   ssds that are  x faster than a sata ssd but the loading times are generally just a tinny little fast when it  not the same  the ps  has a nvme on it that seems to have  gb s reading speed  now that technology has come to consoles do you guys think that this kind of ssd will become a lot better on games 
have a great day

i  been brewing with the light roast filters from cafec for a few months and absolutely loved them  when i reordered them recently they were now labeled as t    light roast coffee paper filters  same mustard yellow color scheme 
the papers felt slightly different and when i pressed along the edge for the mountain fold it didn   feel the same  i used my usual grind setting and unfortunately all of my brews were clogging after the bloom phase with the new papers

i quit drinking energy drinks about   months ago due and  incident  with my health  think small stroke  no sense then my caffeine has come mostly from teas  i know this tea has no caffeine but loads of other good vitamins and mineral can anyone recommend a brand they tried and liked 
i have recently become addicted to forgive for saying this soda  worst mistake of my life  i can   get enough of the stuff  i  been trying to reverse the addiction by drinking straight water   times an hour and if i need a sugar fix i make hot cocoa  no milk or cream only water and powder   neither has worked though  any tips for getting off this addiction 
after waiting it out and grabbing a ps  pro in hopes it could provide a bare minimum in quality compared to my pc  i   actually beyond impressed with the checkerboard  k rendering of the ps  pro with horizon zero dawn its comparable in pretty much every way to the best games i have at  k on my pc 
from my understanding instead of interlacing  every other frame consists of every other line of pixels being rendered and it switches invetween  
checkerboard is very similar in that it create a noise pattern or checkerpattern where half or a third of pixels update in  k and then every new frame the rest of the noise pattern or checkerboard updated those pixels and so fourth 
i really cant distinguish a difference between this and real  k on a   in tv upclose  the pixels are so small you cant make out the   hz refresh on this checkerboard like you could with the lines on      interlaced  its a win win i think 
so again if pc users already have the option in a few games to do     i why couldnt nvidia or amd release drivers to do this kind of rendering 
the performance gain would be incredible 
sunkist and diet sunkist in a two liter tastes absolutely terrible  has anyone else noticed this 
do you have any gaming friends you used to play with a lot and one day out of the blue they stopped coming online  do you miss them too 
i sometimes go over my friends list on various platforms and reminisce  it usually makes me feel sad because i wonder about how they ' re doing or if they ' re still alive and healthy  but then i remember all the fun times with that person  the laughs the inside jokes deciding on which games to buy together  
it hit me really hard when i looked at my xbox live friends list and remembered people i played with back in           
let  remember the lost ones  the ones that signed out for the last time 
idk how to make subreddits so if someone wants to please do

hi guys i was referred here from pf  here  my situation 
my aunt used to do some mlm business selling drinks and i told her it  not worth it  now she  joined some other mlm that sells some skin cream  i tried it and sure it looked like it  worked  but after an hour my skin just felt and looked the same again  she talks about being rich and driving fancy cars but i told her i don   subscribe to that principle of  richness   if she were to take the monthly  membership fee  and stick it into investing or even a savings account i   sure she  probably have more over the long run 
she  lost money in the first mlm  but she hasn   learned and her vision is clouded with the dreams that mlm can provide 
can anyone numerically prove this  or at least persuasively show it  not a good idea  so i can show her the numbers  
can a friend and i login to our profiles on my xbox series s app and remote play together 
i  never enjoyed fruit teas  they smell great but as soon as you take a sip it just tastes like someone walked past an orange with a cup of hot water  however the other day i had a youthberry teavana tea from starbucks and it was amazing  so much flavour  however it  pretty difficult to buy in the uk and it  really expensive as well  so i was wondering if anyone had any suggestions of good  and not heinously expensive  fruit teas that i can find here in the uk  i  prefer ones that come in tea bags for convenience sorry for being a heathen  
​
edit  thank you so much everyone  i  had a load of suggestions so that   keep me going for the next year

they were from a local italian club that had decided to switch out to a nespresso so we think he got them at a pretty good price  he gave them a thorough cleaning but it  pretty evident the grinder needs a new part or a repair  note the duct tape  and we were renting so we couldn   hook up the machine to a water or drainage line  
we  bought a house and brought them out but short of getting a plumber to run water drainage to that spot in the kitchen i   at a loss as to what to do with these  the machine probably needs descaling  has anyone used this model before 
i recently had a laryngectomy to remove the cancer in my throat  prior to that i had chemo and radiation  well due to the damage the radiation caused it  gonna take it much longer to heal  that means i won   be able to drink anything for up to   months or longer while it heals  is there anything i can do to avoid being so thirsty all the time  i have a peg tube that i get nutrition in  is my only option to just keep putting a lot of water in my peg tube to stay hydrated  i must not be doing it enough right now because i   still sooo thirsty  does anyone have any advice on how to quench my thirst

tldr  smart lady tries to sell me on dumb things 
[first a little back story    for   years i have worked for one of the most intelligent women i have ever met  i don   know that i  ever asked her for help with a business or personal question that she doesn   instantly have an answer for  i mean she owns multiple multimillion companies that she has built from the ground up  all the while holding down an awesome marriage raising a child to adulthood then adopting another  when most people would be basking in the glow of the their own greatness of all they have achieved she continues doing  what she is meant to do  
recently i  had some health issues not limited to but including female health issues  the issues are somewhat uncommon for a woman my age and we still aren   completely sure exactly what the cause is and it  a lot of tests and waiting]

bl  so how are you

what is your favorite megaman x game  mine is probably x   i have so many memories of renting it from my local blockbuster when i was a kid and coming home and playing that while shoving a box of gobstoppers in my face  
i had the original mortal kombat and havnt really played once since because as a kid the combos were to complicated for me   but i really got into injustice and i got some what good which made me feel awesome  mortal kombat x looks like it won   dissapoint and i   glad to really get into some fighting games

so  i  made a post on this subreddit before about my mother joining an mlm called  plannet marketing   so far she hasn   lost any money in it but i don   think she  showing anything for it either it just inert at this point 
for context  my mother is in her      she  an intelligent woman and has a master  degree in business  she  been talking about wanting to be her own boss and not wanting to answer to anyone  currently she  been making actual money by making custom clothing for social group she  a part of  it  an off shoot of the mason  basically  and so far she  made        just by making these custom dresses for the women of her group and it start to branch out in making other clothing as well  i   super happy for her and i   actually helping her with her website for her clothing work 
but lately she  been talking about how she wants to have several ways of making money in an effort to  diversify  her income  she first joined plannet  now she  talking about how she wants to join the paparazzi jewelry thing  once again alarm bells started ringing in my head  i  heard about this company before from reading other posts on reddit and seeing stuff on youtube 
i need advice on how to approach my mom about looking closer into these companies  my mother smart but i   afraid to talk to her about this because i   afraid of how she   react  if she thinks i   wrong about something she   get really hostile about it  i   so freaked out about this  i know my mother is smarter than to get sucked into a horror story like the ones i  seen but i just don   want to deal with all of this  when she first started the plannet thing she talked to me about how i can work under her and start making some money  
i   really scared 
for me i would say horizon zero dawn  i am looking forward for the forbidden west

i tried his method a while ago only to get really bitter over extracted coffee  my main problem is the part where he stirs the grounds in order for them to fall to the bottom of the press  is that meant for small batches or does it work even if its a lot of coffee  for reference i was doing a      ratio using about   g of coffee  when i stirred some did stsrt falling but the majority of coffee stsyed at the top whoch is probably why it came out over extracted  how can i make the grounds fall

the new mlm sells cosmetics with  original dead sea ingredients   they never quite specify what ingredients or how much of it  i tried to look it up previously and found absolutely no list of ingredients anywhere 
he spends entire days on the phone and zoom talking about the supposed magical abilities of these products due to their dead sea thing  talking about how it miraclously healed all sorts of vague skin ailments that  no doctor could help  and trying to sell it to his friends 
    which is only made slighly worse by the fact we live in a tourism heavy city right next to the real deal  not only the city is full of dedicated shops selling equally dodgy dead sea products   the actual physical dead sea is less than    minutes drive away 
to start out my regular coffee is made with happy mug to which i have never had any problems with 
after looking around online and noticing that most online orders from roasters are      for   oz of coffee beans while happy mug is      with shipping  for   oz  
the only others that i found that are close to that price range are just coffee coop and modest coffee  do y ' all know any others like them 
i have been using apps to track my water intake but i have seen that these apps don   consider green tea or broth as water sources only plain water  i have also read that it  advised to drink at least two litters of water without counting tea or mate or broth but i have never seen an explanation about why these aren   considered good hydration sources  does the water not get absorbed well for some reason 
i figured that if there was someone who had the answer they would be here 
everyone knows that nintendo switch is coming with some pre existing games with new content  mario kart    deluxe edition which includes new characters race tracks and a new game mode and just dance      is coming too with exclusive songs  and also some other  rd party games that would be ported from switch including some which were never ported in wii u  like lego city undercover jackbox party pack   little inferno world of goo etc  and everybody knows the sm sh  last   dlc characters have still their amiibo in development 
so i come to this theory that future switch games will mostly be a port with new content  so here  my prediction for some ports 
   legend of zelda prequels in hd  k like ww tp ss etc 
   super mario maker for switch with the possibility of every item not added in the wii u one like slanting paths and also costumes can be in any platform 
   sm sh of course with dlc pre included with new characters stages and possibly a story mode and more dlc 
now some other games sequel prediction 
   nintendo land based game   boring 
   animal crossing game  with more characters and items and customization  
   a new super mario game   anyone played it  
   a pikmin sequel 
   metroid sequel   everyone knows 
   a pokemon game  like in the  ds  
   insert your switch games '  ideas here
i   going to teach you how to spot their trapping statement  they do the approach again i   glad i left being the mlm industry    i do advertising and graphic design online  i am that entrepreneur who started a business from scratch is different from being from someone who did mlm  the mindset is differentiy noticed most members who make big bucks don   develop an entrepreneur mindset  which is ironic since most of them claim they are  entrepreneurs  yet act like the opposite   i have nothing against people who spend  but that is the leaders '  objective to make you spend money you don   have    before you know it you   be in the same situation in ridiculous amounts of debt  
now for the tips here are tips so that you can avoid falling into their mlm trap 

often times people from mlm won   be defensive on chat they will do reframes of questions of the conversation back to you  do not fall for it 

example  
mlmer   are you familiar with nuskin  
you   oh yeah that mlm and network marketing    it is good but i am not that interested    
mlmer   oh what  network marketing  
notice that they will retract the answer back to a question  it  their tactic to keep you engaged

trench retreat via call 

they will call you and in this format your mind will be forced to conform  
they will send a miss call 
example  
after the miss call you might call back and they   go like i   call you back ok  
after a miss call more so you call back 
mlmer   hey how are you  
you  chit chat
mlmer  chitchat
you  somehow the convo call gets you to ask and be curious of what the heck the mlmer is doing nowadays
mlmer   that  good oh by the way i have to take this important call  this call is like   minutes  i will message you when you can call  
 mlmer after   minutes they will message you to call back and you call back    they say they just took a call from their business 
you have just complied in their frame of control  and now you appear interested 

constraint bind

after say you you get to have a lengthy chat via over the phone or via chat    they will ask a schedule wherein you ' re available  in the time they have given you instead of you deciding which time would be convenient for you,they will decide for you  
they will give you two choices only 
mlmer   when are you available     in morning or   in the afternoon  
you     pm 
mlmer   awesome so are you available this friday  pm or sunday  pm  
you   sunday    
mlmer   alright so we   meet this sunday  pm i  booked a schedule with my  ' boss '  let  meet this sunday    minutes advance ok  
notice they deliberately force you to pick a schedule and time  that constraint bind is designed to make you feel that you have a choice but in reality you only have   choices    
stay vigilant  ^_^
i thought y ' all would appreciate this  in late      or early      i purchased some monat from a friend to be supportive  didn   really do much for me at first wasn   that impressed  then that plus the stress of life equaled noticeable hair loss  it took me a little while to make the connection  
i didn   really say anything to my friend since she just always pushed my flex ship order for me and never pushed me to order more  
so now she has gotten out of it and she sent all of her clients info on how to dance their flexships  i am on a chat with a csr about cancelling  it all seems easy until she says  oh you only completed   of the   required flexships in your contract  so if you cancel you would owe     termination fee 
i said considering your product caused me hair loss  i think the least you can do is just cancel the membership without penalty  
she asked if i wanted to speak with a  product specialist  regarding the hair loss  i said nope  i know the products don   work for me  that really wouldn   do anything for me  she then states that she will go ahead and cancel the membership without penalty  
super paranoid that i   still going to get charged at some point but here  hoping  
i   debating on buying legend of korra but i want to know how the game is first

alright back to lurking mode     
i   new around here first post on this sub and i was wondering what kinds of teas you guys are into   atm i   really into   teas    tea tea and   herbal  

  english breakfast tea  loose  from twinings
  honey vanilla chamomile herbal tea from celestial seasonings
  cranberry vanilla wonderland herbal  holiday tea  from celestial as well 

so i was wondering what teas are you into atm 
by tonight or the next few days this sub will reach   ,    subscribers 
incredible  i discovered this sub  i think through askreddit  this past december and it  like i found a new home  i can   remember how many subscribers we had back then   i want to say   ,    but whatever the amount was it was way fewer than where we are at now 
thanks y ' all for making this my favorite sub to browse and give yourself a pat on the back because being anti mlm is righting wrongs and triumphing over evil 
cheers < 
if you don   care about themes don   bother reading the rest of this post  
just makes me laugh how we  had the  themes  option in system settings for   years now yet they  managed to figure out how to change the theme in estore with new animations as well  
i was expecting themes like the  ds by now or at the very least different colours  not everyone minds but i do and i   sure there are others  i   also someone who enjoys profile pictures which i see everytime i boot up a game estore check what my friends are playing and play different games  
by now we should be able to set our own profile images like xbox does have multi coloured themes in settings and purchasable game themes with a free monthly one for nso subscribers 
edit  it won   even let me load up my settings either
i have a friend who i will be gifting my old switch to  he spends a lot of time in hospital and the plan is for us to play via the internet together while he is there hopefully staving off boredom a little  we ' re hoping for something with some depth to it which can be played two player  my first suggestion was monster hunter rise which i   pretty sure he   love  diablo and borderlands might also be good options  i  be really grateful for any other ideas or just your personal favourites  thank you so much 
edit  several words because i can   type 
hey everyone  i just noticed the bonavita electric kettle seems to be at a good price on amazon 
and the     l is just   dollars more than the   l 
as a household of   with no plans of changing that soon would the   l be best 
we both enjoy teas  me more so than him    and rarely do we have guests over and if we do i don   see the big deal in adding more water and waiting for the next batch to be heated up 
does anyone have input on what size kettle they prefer 
yeah yeah i know what this group is about but i want to try it out not for the money but curious about the whole experience 
as a backstory i am currently a salesman promoting fibre internet service i came across this woman who happens to be a atomy sales rep she started inviting me into her house and i agreed because i thought i was going to get a sale  we then have a little chit chat and she started the introduction being a young adult    y ' o  i was very curious and listened carefully  heck i even registered an account with my identification card  
i   not very interested in the sales aspect to be honest but very curious to try out their coffees and other heap products  all in all wish me luck and please leave a comment to share your story and thoughts 
this is what my x y looks like which is most natural to me 
http   imgur com ifhstfz  
maybe it  my hand wrist grip or maybe it  the mouse itself  i think it  the former because my fiance has a perfect x y axis   
i don   see any setting in windows that allows me to calibrate x y  are there any  rd party apps or mice with software that allows this 
if you ' re switch is still in version       and not shutting down when in sleep mode try to avoid updating to       or you may begin to experience it  my switch was completely fine until i updated it  
i just got it back two days ago after issues with my joy con drifting   after being initially excited with the console i have just been pretty let down by nintendo after   months of  having it  
edit  not to say i don   love the switch  i just wish nintendo was better with the updates joy cons online features and app availability  
the upgrade removes the media feature pack for n users and you   be left out of playing some games including gta v and ds   possibly many more   microsoft needs to release an updated version for the media feature pack 
obviously answers will vary but what is your go to drink when trying a new cafe for the first time to see how it stands up  this barista i know says a flat white so was interested to see what others thought

i apologize if this has already been asked i couldn   find the answer to this specific question when i googled it  i have the ps  slim but i did recently buy a nice  k tv  i  never owned an xbox before but i want to get more into multiplayer stuff and i  really like to have  k gaming  i guess my main question is does the xbox have a big enough library to justify buying a new console   it  on sale which is why i   considering it but it  still a chunk of change   i don   plan on buying the scarlet at least not at launch  so it would be my only xbox for a while  i thought about maybe getting the one s but that doesn   seem like a big enough improvement to go for  so yeah if anyone owns both and can tell me if it  worth it i  greatly appreciate it 
i   from the island and i  love to get my hands on some of the imported sodas you guys have posted here  anyone on here live in the nyc metro area tri state area   i   from central long island if that helps

i  searched high and low for it after having one in germany a few years ago  so far nothing has turned up 
i live very close to jungle jim  outside of cincinnati   no luck there   is it really that difficult to find 
so i received an e mail this morning stating that my sign in id was changed and that if i didn   intend that to visit support when i clicked on the link it takes me to a     not found  when i try to go through normal support avenues  live chat or phone  the live chat requires my sign in id and psn name which are obviously different now since it was changed without my permission  the phone is apparently not working on the weekends  is there anything i can do about this 
edit if anyone else has this issue you can have a friend  or use a second account  log in to the live chat and explain the situation  they   help you out 
i knew right off the bat when she sent me an invitation to the l ' brie party was an mlm scam   she message me a few days after she sent me the invite  asking if i was coming and she was being pushy about it   i told her that i couldn   come and that i was  busy    she just responded   okay   which is a pretty cold response   i wondered if that is the reason she friends with me in the first place   back before i knew about mlm  i had spent time with her  she tried to give me a lot of stuff  a lot of them are cheaply made products i have seen on this mlm page  i feel hurt because i shared a lot of personal things with her and she as well   we have been friends for several years and this is the first time she invited me to this kind of event  
these are   games i   looking forward to be released on ps    but they have been saying that it was going to be released on ps  about a year ago and still no change and no news from the devs i   just wondering if anybody on here has an idea when will any of these will be released  also and particularly h z  and the forest  i lost all hope in day z 
not sure if this post is allowed here  i didn   see any rules that wouldn   permit it but if not let me know and i can remove it 
thanks

so i  been gaming at     p   fps on pc for quite some time now and i  recently started to become interested in what    fps would feel like  
my primary interest in    fps would be for single player action games like dragons dogma monster hunter world vanquish yakuza   etc  to be honest i   mostly interested to see what vanquish  one of my all time favourite games  would feel like in    fps with how rapid and intense the game  action is 
the only problem is i also play a lot of fighting games like tekken   skullgirls umvc  and soon to be soul calibur   and fighting games are always locked at   fps and will never support higher than that  my main worry is let  say if i experience    fps in vanquish is this going to completely kill   fps for me in tekken    
i can already tell how clunky a game looks in   fps when i  swapped between       in a game  settings so i   just worried with    fps being double of   fps it  going to produce the same feeling to a greater extent  so if anyone could answer these   main worries i have that would be great 


  fps doesn   feel broken for me so should i really go for the jump  if anyone uses    fps for the games i   interested in using it for i could do with your impressions of it  will my mind be blown because that  what i   expecting especially if i   going for    fps with g sync 


does anyone that plays    fps compatible games have any problems going back to a separate game that can only run at   fps max  


thanks 
i really need to send them an e mail  i can   call them tweet them or facebook them  i really need an e mail adress

i saw an article linked in the comments of the awesome tea leaf taxonomy post that recommends no more than   grams of tea per person per day   i generally use more than that in one  gong fu  brewing session and sometimes i partake in up to five sessions a day   i don   experience any issues with caffeine or otherwise wheher i drink tea made from    grams of leaf on a weekend day or whether i am too busy during the week that i don   get a chance to drink tea for two or three days   what are r tea  thoughts on this

to be honest i would rather the switch launched with the virtual console than the  n indies games that we have had so far  i would enjoy playing supermario world for the umpteenth time more than binding of issac or has been heros  
i appreciate there are some good indie games and have bought fast rmx and snipperclips but have zero interest in stuff like world of goo  
i   an idiot but it  pretty sweet i   not gonna lie 
i  had my launch day switch for a while now and i wanted to hold out until nintendo   next gen switch  but i figured playing the new kirby rune factory   and breath of the wild   would look pretty glorious on oled 
my first impressions are very strong it  a well built unit and the screen is beyond fantastic  true black is a thing of beauty  did anybody else have a change of heart  if so what do you think so far 
hi there  i was wondering if anyone could help me with an issue i   having  this is really a constant thing kinda but it  a trend i   noticing with hot teas  i can   really taste alot of them well they tend to be lightly flavored water sometimes spicey if it  got cinnamon or ginger n such in the blend and that  all fine and enjoyable of course i still like it but i   starting to feel a lil     i guess uncertain 
going off reviews of a blend my friends opinions and such i feel like i should be getting a much stronger flavor from alot of the brews i try we all basically brew our teas the same to our knowledge i used     heaped teaspoons  about   grams    oz of water just off the kettle  usually unless it needs to be a lil cooler for the tea  and brew for the instructed time in my gravity steeper the last one i brewed being salted caramel lebukchen from bird and blend yet the most i   getting from it is a slight gingery spice despite the fact others seem to be getting more notes from it 
as a better example sticky chai i brewed that multiple ways and despite the fact others got a lot of spicey and sweet notes i really just got a kind of milky black tea helped by honey  now it was nice don   get me wrong it was alright but not what i feel i should be getting from it 
i  noticed when i cold brew      teaspoons   oz i believe left overnight  i can much much better tastes the flavors i   looking for it  alot stronger and usually quite tasty 
i just genuinely cant tell if there  something wrong with my taste buds if i   doing something or if i   maybe expecting too much 
i was considering trying out matcha as i hear that  got a stronger flavor that and it just seems interesting  
and also maybe try gong fu as i hear that leads to stronger flavors 
i guess this has turned into a bit of a long rant more than a solid question and probably me overthinking quite a bit about this but i thought it might be worth posting to see if i can get any input  if anyone could help with their own personal experience or point in the right direction that  be nice  sorry for the long rant hahaha

i know a lot of readers of this sub are on the constant quest for blueberry bomb coffees and s&w craft roasting  new banko fuafuate qualifies for sure  this is definitely  blueberry lemonade  in coffee form  my palate shifted a couple years ago and i can pull out strawberry blackberry raspberry every berry but blueberry from coffee anymore and this is definitely hitting me over the head as a blueberry bomb  lots of lemon acidity too but overall this is a really sweet delicious cup  i haven   tried it as espresso yet and my guess is that lemon may be a little too much for that method but i   about to find out  what blueberry bombs have you found recently 
looking for recommendations of a good root beer syrup  i   quite partial to virgil  but they only make the finished product  i own a sodastream and love experimenting with new flavors  i tried the  genuine root beer syrup  from portland soda works it is okay but not quite what i   looking for  there are many generic concentrates out there but i   trying to avoid artificial flavors artificial colors and high fructose corn syrup  any recommendations

~~i   keep this short  maybe one of you can offer advice ~~
~~on november    this past wednesday i noticed about      worth of purchases made to my sony account that i did not authorize  pretty much immediately i went through the motions of security perseveration ~~
~~i put in my refund request only hours after the charges had been made but i  not heard anything back from them about it since  checking my account on the website none of the purchases are listed as having been  played  or  downloaded  so i   hoping for good results ~~
~~this evening i come to find out that my ps  had been deactivated and switched out for    some other ps  out there most likely whoever had gotten into my account now because of this much of my games library is no longer available to play on my ps  and because sony only allows for   console deactivation every   months whoever got into my account either owns my games for   months or they are now locked in the ether ~~
~~i talked to sony support on this and they basically told me to get over it  apparently they just don   have the ability to reinstate my account  deactivation use nor can they deactivate it themselves ~~
~~wonderful i just wanted to play death stranding  if anyone has any advice or would at least be willing to ease my pain with a pat on the back i  appreciate it ~~

edit  false alarm  
the situation is still as it stands but it seems i can still use my purchased games 
my younger sister just got into the arbonne cult  she swears up and down they are  the best and loves them   she lost her job where she was making     an hour loved the company she worked for  she got talked into selling this company  stuff 
she also was giving me the whole  ' i get a new mercedes for selling arbonne  they ' re a good company  my husband has used them for years   
i   worried  i tried to warn her that arbonne is a scam and mlms rope people into debt and screw them over  she won   listen  
she  living with her husband and i told her she  not going to really be making much money doing mlm 
some background a friend of mine purchased a commercial setup on craigslist  fb   lm some mazzer grinder a fetco and an ek  he asked me to swing by and dial in a coffee and make sure everything works  ek and fetco are all set making great coffee  something in the espresso setup is wrong 
i can   get a good extraction to save my life  only on this setup i get        extraction on my home setup   the shots are sour and unbalanced  i can   get them to over extract and no shot has gotten past     extraction  i  tried up to a     ratio and extraction   doesn   get better 
the water measured   c coming out of the screen  pressure is reaching   bars and sitting there  no obvious channeling on the bottomless portafilter  the coffee is a light medium colombian 
i  never encountered this before and clearly something is off  is there something obvious i   missing  best guess is the mazzer burrs are super dull but i  never encountered that issue before  tia

hi hope this is the right place way to post this 
i have been trying to use a portable   w   v @    a  mu charger to charge my switch and it works great charging the switch when playing and quickly when in sleep mode 
however this only works with a gopro usb a to c cable the nintendo pro controller usb a to c cable and one i purchased from anker barely seem to provide any power with the same wall adapter and can barely charge the switch when it  in sleep mode and discharges at a normal rate when playing 
any ideas why this is the case  the gopro cable is very short and inconvenient to play and charge with so this is why i want to find a longer cable that can charge my switch properly 
many thanks for any help

edit   lido   
own the breville smart grinder  not the advanced one with the extra settings  and use it for aeropress pourover and occasionally espresso machine and french press  i  stopped using it for espresso since i totally can   get consistent grind and even for pourover i have to sieve out the fines or else it gets clogged up 
in canada exchange shipping a lido ends up at       i   trying to determine if the quality is significantly higher than the automatic grinder i already have and whether it   be worth it  i have owned a manual grinder before and had no issues with the time and effort just that it was pretty cheap and was worse than the smart grinder  
thoughts  i   thinking i would use it only for when i want to make my espresso or pourovers on the gourmet coffees from fresh local roaster is and use the auto grinder for the costco stuff on my weekday in a rush mornings 
cheers and thanks for the advice help with a topic that has been very overdone here  just i  never seen a comparison of this sort before 
is there any reason this scenario will not work 
coffee grounds in a filtered funnel with ice cubes directly on top of the coffee grounds   as the ice cubes melt onto the grounds the coffee goes through the filter and into the vessel below   basically the expensive drip cold brew apparatuses with the ice directly on the grounds instead of being dripped from above 
i   too cheap to buy a fancy adjustable drip cold brew thing to compare the difference in outcome so i   curious what you all would expect the difference to be 
thanks  
please comment if you use it and enjoy

my mom is working on improving her english and she got a bit bored of movies books and studying so i suggested to her she should try games     years ago she enjoyed playing simon the sorcerer syberia and jack orlando so i was thinking to introduce her to something similar 
the problem is she won   be able to keep up with a text speech at natural speed and she often needs to refer to a dictionary to check words she doesn   know so we are looking for a game where it  possible to manually scroll each line  my mom isn   a big fan of gaming so the gameplay must be minimal 
i was never really interested in hot tea but a canister of san dji tea from akrafo was included with last month  snack box from try the world  i fell in love with it when i first smelled the exotic  to me  mixture of rooibos marula vanilla and blood orange  finished off the canister in a week and i can   find a way to order more  the company  website doesn   have a way to shop  that i could tell  and i  sent multiple emails to their support address 
i do find a bag of rooibos with vanilla and blood orange from another company and while it is good it doesn   compare to the akrafo blend  any help would be awesome for this tea noob

being a    year old and a junior naturally i have instagram  i was just looking in my recommended and there  was a hun from herbalife     people from school were following her   i   so disappointed 😭 i didn   know who else to tell but i just want say something here  i don   run into mlms very often in real life so i was shocked when i saw it  along with the hun another girl from my school might be dabbling in it too     as she  following monat 🥲 i really hope she doesn   fall into it though as she  only    or        she  a senior 
online i read that it was    gb the back of the box says it    ,but now that i  installed it and the       version it  only     is there something i   missing

more on my situation  i   an adult child of an mlm mom  growing up my mom tried an mlm  bought diet shakes for herself and made me use them but never got into the scheme  
for her semi retirement she  gotten really into one  she says she  one of the top sellers in the company from the numbers she shares i   guessing she makes about minimum wage  the household isn   losing money   the problem is that when she first started it six months ago both me and my brother raised concerns about it being a pyramid scheme and she got really defensive and got mad at us for not being supportive  now i just don   respond when she tells me about how her sales are going she  really into it and when she talks about it i feel like i   being given a sales pitch it makes me really uncomfortable 
i  talked to her a bit about christmas this year and she  giving most remote relatives the products from the mlm and she  said she  done all her christmas shopping for everyone  i   really uncomfortable with this i have no idea how i should react to her promoting her mlm at christmas and absolutely no idea how to respond if me or my immediate family are gifted these products  advice is welcome  also sharing similar stories would really make me feel less alone on this 
usually when a sale or coupon is expiring you get the entire day to purchase no   so if it says the sale is through dec   th you can still get it up until close of business on the   th    nintendo doesn   use this model   if you really want something off the e shop you better pull the trigger at least a day before it says the sale will end   i was going to buy the jackbox pack #  today  on sale through the   th  but it  already gone

 r tea seems to be a pretty active community  there are obviously many people from across the globe with a variety of experiences and preferences involved here  while many of these people are pretty comfortable about where they are in their tea journey i  noticed several who want to learn more and explore more tea  in other words seeking guidance 
there are definitely several posters who are a bit more knowledgeable but often are modest because taste is preference not fact and everyone was a novice at one point  in fact everyone here goes above and beyond not stepping on toes almost but not quite to a fault  
i think you gurus know who you are i see you posting every once in a while with a super specific region and super specific pot with super specific water temps  etc  you guys are great about not invalidating us novices '  tea journeys but i think it also means you ' re holding back 
so to my point   i think it would be great if we did weekly  or even biweekly because this is such an active subreddit  q&a or ama type deal  or even a community discussion thread  it  be different than haul show and tells because everyone is so supportive and isn   going to tell you your jon doe tea co  haul is child  play 
possible topics could be what kind of pot do i need for black tea how to brew matcha how to have a proper high tea herbal teas     what is the sign of a proper pu erh etc  i know this gets discussed now but it  be great to have the experts not hold back their knowledge for sake of friendliness  kind of like constructive criticism 
maybe we could even have an  r asktea   i dream big 
we are a small office with     people and we currently got two moccamaster technivorm machines and cheap pre ground supermarket coffee 
i really want to give the office coffee an upgrade so i have been considering getting us a grinder and some much better coffee directly from a local roaster  however i am a bit stuck when it comes to figuring out which grinder to get 
i am considering a  mazzer mini filter  however i have been unable to find any reviews or posts about the      filter version of the mazzer mini and spending almost    €  danish prices  seems like a lot for a grinder solely for drip coffee  
alternatively i have been looking at either a baratza vario or possibly the forté bg 
it is important that the grinder has some predefined settings as most people in the office don   want to spend too much time fuzzing around with a grinder to make a pot of coffee 
does anyone have any experience with the mazzer mini filter or have any alternative recommendations for a grinder for a small office setup in that price range 
i am new to drinking coffee   at work we are given daz bog svoboda blend  http   store dazbog com svoboda blend     oz bag html  which i have learned to enjoy   at home i have a keurig   are there any k cups that might be similar in taste to the svoboda blend 
if not are there any medium strength k cup flavors that you would recommend 
thanks 
so i just got my series s and i thought i could use my ps  headset with it but i can    can someone let me know what kind of headset i could get
i   looking for a sweet fruity tea  my parents do not like the black tea that i have  any recommendations 
happy international coffee day coffee lovers 
i always buy the same speciality beans from the same place for various reasons but i  like to get out of my comfort zone today  i have never bought coffee online and i   try two or three different coffee beans you people suggest today 
i encourage people to do something different to celebrate because i   guessing my country isn   the only one that canceled coffee festivals due to the pandemic 
ps  i   post a brief review of the beans i   try 
oh i live in southern europe  happy brewing everyone 
personally i really like milky blue tea from mariage freres
mines coming up to   years old now  i  played it for thousands of hours  i  got     just on smash     on dead cells  in fact most of my main games have well over     hours each  i  played     docked since i got my switch  i played the first year entirely handheld and then since then almost always docked and touch wood not had any problems with it  
ive always got a fear of something happening to my switch  they aren   exactly easy to come by now and are still pretty expensive for me  i look after mine very well  never take it out but switch is my main console  i don   play anything else anymore but switch so if something happened to mine that would be it for a long time and considering i play it daily and that would suck  
so has anyone had a day   switch and it either had problems or not  not including joycon drift  what would you do if something did happen to your switch and how long is your expectation of life for you switch  
with the way i treat mine i   hoping i get another   years out of mine before i start getting problems  hopefully by then they are cheaper and easier to get 
so i   looking to sell an xbox one s  tb with the box along with minecraft and forza motorsport   how do i price it  i shan   go above £    because no one will buy it  any advice would be appreciated
i am thinking about building putting together a desk within december  was wondering what kind of desk you guys use recommend 
has anybody here located a brand of soda called wildwood  i  been trying to get my hands on it for forever now but it seems to have fallen off the face of the planet  thanks 
it  my favorite flavor but strangely it seems like only mtn  dew makes it  that  odd given how you can find most popular flavors in smaller or more generic brands  big k for example has a ton of odd ball flavor sodas but no baja blast knock off that i know of 
i  heard that baja blast is just regular dew with a lime flavor  not sure but there  always been a big demand for it and pepsi co keeps withholding it from people because of their deal with taco bell 
if there exists an off brand of it i  like to know 
or really any good cherry soda in    packs at my local stores  i live in texas 
imagine if the slider of the grip was shaped like a v the layout of the controls would resemble that of a pro controller  the downside of that would be the d pad having a diagonal position  do you know what i mean   maybe someone wants to make a mock up of that  
https   perfectaim io cheats destiny   

a claim has been made by bungie inc    bungie   suggesting that this product violates the game  license agreement  furthermore a demand was made that we cease and desist from selling this product   
we won   comment on whether these claims are justified or not but have decided to comply with this demand regardless  we are sorry for any inconvenience caused to our customers 

edit  looks like bungie has pulled the trigger on yet another website 
i   currently playing through the december ps plus free game just cause    i would like to get the expansions which are included with the gold edition of the game on sale right now for     off  i   very tempted to buy it but i also don   want to lose my progress because i  unlocked so many areas already

hey there i had my first root beer yesterday at a friend of a friends house yesterday and it was magnificent  sadly i forgot what brand it was  as root beer is hard to come by here in germany i wanted to ask what your favourite brands are so i don   end ordering a disgusting one by accident   
i  have the switch light   i have animal crossing new horizon   i  ordered amiibo animals for my daughter and i to use    she has been able to bring her chosen animals onoard   
when i go though my three days of invitation and they are unable to move in her character days she   get them in the island by swapping out animals   
i do not get this option   my animal tells me they can   get on and there is no further dialog from my character   nothing   i click the animal to talk and i get nowhere  i  tried this on the different characters including one she has used and it  the same issue  
can anyone help me figure out what  going on and help me fix the issue 
thank you in advance 
i   paying a lot but don   you think a coffee shop should be good at what they do and embrace the roasters expertise   i mean i   buying from an outstanding roaster in the st louis area and very satisfied   yes i wish i could save on my costs but think there is a line   we can   all be good at everything 
so i start at a     tomorrow and within the first two interviews i found out that this could potentially be a multi level marketing  as explained by the president there is a recruitment hierarchy but i am not required to climb the ladder and all the pay is based on how much i sell however it was stated that none of what i am selling comes from my expenses  i  never experienced one myself however i   aware of the risk involved where you have to actually put money in to see no returns  cutco herbalife amway etc     my concern is how bad this could turn out for me  is it worth my time working   days a week to get strictly commission or do newcomers like myself usually fallout and waste most their time 
edit  some minor details
update  thanks all i   taking your advice here and listening to my gut  i   be thinking of suggestions or thoughts to how to cut ties before my first day 
you use a tom of tea leaves for a small amount of water i tried it once and if i brew like this regularly it will burn through my tea leaves stock  any advice 
hi there,
i   from southern california and a buddy of mine was just on a business trip to texas where he binged on green striped cans of  dr  pepper made with sugar     he praised it and said it was fantastic   back home and just yesterday we wanted to see if we could locate some of this in california and sought out our local soda pop shop  pretty popular and well known around here and nationally i think but i wont mention the name    we asked the owner about this  dr  pepper made with sugar  and the owner stated it is a corporate lie    that there is no dr  pepper or like product coming out of texas made with cane sugar and that the definition of sugar has been changed in recent times and that the soda actually contains a mixture     to    i think was said  of high fructose corn syrup and glucose and contains no cane sugar  being what the general populace thinks of as  ' real '  sugar    the owner stated that by definition it is  ugar '  they ' re made with but not cane sugar as is generally expected when that statement is used 
so i guess i   posting here to ask people  opinions on this  candal '     does anyone know any information let alone know what i   talking about   i trust this store owner with anything soda related so i pretty much believe him    but i was curious if anyone knew anything else about this   also along those lines    any of the corporate sodas   ade with real sugar '     are they also a  ' lie '    pepsi made with real sugar   hrowback '  sodas etc    they ' re not actually made with cane sugar 
so obviously this past year was so rough for gaming  from cyberpunk onwards basically every aaa game flopped off launch  i actually think this would have happened even without covid   there  no denying that certain old games released poorly and we ' re able to head the water upstream to come back in popularity   no man  sky and destiny are two that pop up in my mind right away   i think the gaming industry got too confident with this mindset of wow we can release a half baked game and fix it later   but when covid hit later all of a sudden becomes so much later  game devs knew from cyberpunk to never release a half baked game but yet it seems as if no development studio learned that lesson even when they know it will cost them financially   i think the one thing battlefield halo and cyberpunk have in common is they truly believed they could release a bad game and make it better and people would come back to play it later  maybe there is a huge market for this but as pointed out on a bf     post that games in shambles and realistically won   be getting an update for around two months   that  costing them serious cash not to mention the cash they  already lost from poor reviews refunds etc  so i guess the one thing that still stumps me is these are companies  companies exist to make money  so are they fine knowingly making less money then they could  because that doesn   seem like the gaming companies we know  i guess they truly believed they could release games in whatever state they choose and be making billions   it  so odd because these companies are incredibly good at making money i  argue too good but yet they ' re actively choosing not to   what am i missing here    
i think the outer worlds   trailer was correct   it  just all a load of nonsense and i don   really need to see some cliché animation that has nothing to do with the game 
edit  there seems to be some confusion 
i   not asking to differentiate between game engine footage that has the quality level set to  e   and  real world  settings    i literally want a link flair for this sub to say whether the game trailer features any of the game or is just an animated cartoon rendered in  ds max or maya etc 
post and link flairs exist already to organise posts so we don   need to debate whether they need to exist 
i   asking for a link flair here so i know whether i am going to see some of the game or not

i just ordered a  tb     evo for my ps  slim and did my research to find out that the dram cache in newer ssds don   really give any meaningful advantage over a cheaper dramless ssd 
the thing is that i also like buying quality parts such as samsung branded ssds which tend to be good quality compared to a no name brand that i might be able to get for cheap 
should i spend the extra money on a quality ssd with dram cache or should i find something cheaper that doesn   have dram cache  
hi i want to stop smoking and would love instead dig into tea culture  is there any tea which might help me with fighting it or be so good to replace me the enjoyment  i think there must be  also note that when youth i suffered from epi seasures so nt sure if i can drink all kinds of teas or if to avoid some of them  caffein is no problem for me at all usually i drink about     espresso a day  thank you very much for your suggestions

i tried searching for similar posts but didn   have any luck sorry if this is a repost  my local farmer  market  atlanta  has tons of great plain tea for cheap  i want to experiment with adding my own flavors to them  so far i  added coconut shavings to green tea during steeping  it was delicious  and i   thinking of experimenting with lavender next  
does anybody else do this  what do you add and how how much  
before i start i want to say that this isn   a tea glorification post  so please don   flame me too hard for karma farming  this is me just sharing my story because my wife is probably exhausted of me talking about how much i love tea now and how good i feel 
background 
i was a pretty avid coffee drinker  i would usually brew a pot in the morning and drink it during the day until about  pm  my wife and i went through a lot of anxiety inducing trauma earlier this year and the general angst was really messing with my life  i would drink coffee during the day and a beer or two at night to relax and calm down  it was wreaking havoc on my blood pressure sleep skin and general well being  i knew that it was time to start making healthier changes so the first one was to replace coffee with tea  i didn   know anything about tea but i knew the generic statement  tea is healthy   so i just swapped it out with a loose leaf black tea  h&s   and here we are a month later 
the feels 
so the first week was hard as i swapped out my caffeine dependency but even in the afternoons i felt significantly better 
the second week was better and at the end of the second week i swapped out alcohol for tisanes  it was at this point that i got my first night of sleep without thrashing about and waking up several times during the night 
week three was when i felt like i was losing my caffeine dependency  i  been able to move away from high caffeine teas without noticing anything  i felt like i was finally able to drink the teas i wanted without feeling the consequence of having too little caffeine  
week four   after looking back over the last month i  seen a significant difference to the way i feel  i have clarity and focus in the afternoons  normally my focus would be shot around  pm   my skin is more clear  i  been able to sleep consistently at night and haven   felt my heart  ' flutter '  in a month  oh and my breath is way better  the most surprising thing is that my mouth feels noticeably fresh all day long  i   not scared to talk to people anymore  lol  oh and my hands feel better  i   a programmer and my hands normally get fatigued by the end of the day but in drinking tea  maybe because of the hydration   i have noticed that my hands just  feel better   it  hard to describe but it  noticeable because of my job 
i don   think that tea is      the reason that these things have happened but replacing coffee and alcohol with tea absolutely has made a difference in my general well being  i really don   want to give the impression that i   advertising anything but i want to share my story with you all  i felt like i was falling into that lifestyle of sluggishness so typical of many americans but as of today i feel so much better  now i   deep in the rabbit hole of tea  i   post about what i  learned next time  xd
​
i would absolutely love to hear your stories 
i saw a post about stupid ai and it lead me to think of games with really smart ai 
asuh fellow homies,
been trying to drink more water lately based on the recommendations for my build type but i feel like it  just making me have to pee a lot more like once every       minutes on average  am i drinking too much  is there something wrong with my bladder 
stay moist brethren and sistren 
i have an opportunity to get either of these at around the same price  around           usd  to upgrade from a rancilio silvia  i have no experience with the e   grouphead series of machines so i   a little lost as to the relative advantages disadvantages of each model 
what would people recommend and why  
after watching tb  wtf is ac u i thought performance would be awful since he had sli    s  i decided to pick the game up today for     and i  been getting        fps on everything maxed except for aa  with aa on msaa x  my performance was of course horrible  when i turned it down to fxaa i was getting great framerate          and msaa x  didn   cause my framerates to drop that much  ~    fps   did the new patch fix performance or did the game just come with horrible optimization for the  xx series of cards 
has there been any reliable testing done to see if the  nd or  rd brews of a cup of tea release more l theanine or caffeine than the  st brew  as someone trying to use the l theanine in tea medicinally i was hoping someone has this figured out 
as someone who purchased crash bandicoot n  sane trilogy for ps  but never got too far in it because other games came up i decided i   going to complete the original game after which i   going to trade it in and put that money toward the switch version to play the second and third games  
playing it tonight i was reminded just how challenging the game can be  you ' re timing must be absolutely impeccable with zero hesitation  there  very little room for error in this game  slippery climb which is considered by far one of the most difficult crash levels ever took me almost two hours to beat  you may laugh but i look forward to hearing your speed the first time you play it  
just wanted to share this as a warning for first time players that although it looks like a fun relatively simple game the challenge is no joke  
first of all i have the screen shots of her post  redacted of course  made them on imgur and apparently reddit doesn   think it  a valid link  i posted it in safari and it to me to the page immediately  so if you want to see exactly what she said let me know and i   give you the link  
i had kind of gotten complacent because the person selling monat stopped and i was so thankful  the other day though i came across the ever dreaded  i  started selling      post but hoped against hope she would post about it all the time  
i want to jump in and say that i take adderall xr for my narcolepsy  i   not functional without it and my husband and all my doctor will attest to that  
so i was scrolling and i see it  one of her posts  i read it because they usually enough up making themselves look silly  
the picture was her holding an orange drink and in the caption she detailed what was in it  shocker  it  all arbonne stuff  she mentions one product and calls it  aka our healthy adderall   that stung but went on  the end is where i get angry and i need someone to tell me if it  okay to feel this way  her statement read  not only do you get the crazy amount of energy our  mind health   wtf   helps with focus memory and brain fog  these products have helped people come off their prescribed adderall or vyvanse   
i am so close to saying my piece  i   take advice on what to say how to say it anything 
sometimes i want something other than coffee and yet have it be in a similar enough to get me into the world of teas  
thanks 
edit  my favorite coffee i recently had was a lovely bright and orangey acidic notes  another favorite was chocolate covered raspberries   note these are notes not actually additives 
mine was hollow knight  now i   going to read your responses for my next game to buy lol
it happened a couple minutes ago i just realized how awful soda is  
so i used to drink root bear a lot like one every day  when we ran out id just wait until my dad buys more as he also drinks it  a couple months went by and he forgot to buy it for all those months  yesterday he came back home with some and at this point i  had forgotten all about it  when i looked in the fridge and saw the soda i was like  well i am thirsty  i took a sip and i hated it  the worst part is i should have realized i hated it all along i never even liked it in the first place so why keep drinking it  who knows  but now i know for sure i am a full fledged hydro homie  water only 
interested to explore the very best 
mine so far is the imperial  aaa  tie guan yin of anxi oolong tea of fujian  from yunnan sourcing

hi all i   getting a pour over as a mother  day gift   she   mostly use it for herself or for two & she drinks half strength lattes so she  not going to have a mug of strong coffee  she     she can get it how she likes it now   there  a    ml & a    ml i  been looking at it but i   not sure if the bigger one works for when she can have people over again & can make also make a smaller amount or it  better to get the smaller one  does the size of the maker count when it  making a smaller amount or is it just a matter of using less coffee & water for the same outcome   thanks for any help i  been googling but i haven   been able to work it out  thanks 
a woman i went to high school with opened a  health  shake store in my small town  they sell protein shakes that have flavors like s  ores and dark chocolate raspberry cheesecake but claim they ' re healthy and often talk about customers '  weight loss successes  anyway the girl who owns it has been a herbalife consultant for years and now uses her store to sell pricey herbalife shakes and aloe tea to the unaware people in my town  that alone makes me mad because the shakes are not good so overpriced and there  no disclaimer that it  herbalife or description of what  actually in the shakes 
but now i  heard through the grapevine that she  requiring her employees to buy into herbalife   based on her instagram i could tell all the store employees were in her downline in herbalife but now i have a first hand account telling me she makes her employees  a high school student in this case  purchase   ,    worth of product plus pay a      start up fee to work there  they make commissioned based on how many shakes they sell and can only use their individually labeled stash of powder to make the shakes  and the owner knows that these kids don   have   k to drop  that  why they ' re getting a job  so she works out a  payment plan  so essentially her employees are indebted to her  i guess she pays them so they ' re technically contractors for tax purposes 
i just think the whole thing is so shady and predatory  she  hiring college and high school kids who don   know better and like the idea of making     hr which is what she claims  i   wondering if this is even legal   it seems insane and so so sketchy 
just received my lido e t as it just arrived in the uk yesterday 
upon unboxing i noticed that the burrs were not aligned as there was fair amount of burr rub off the bat  i began attempting the realignment process using videos that oe uploaded on youtube and got to the point where the screw responsible for loosening burr rub on a specific side could not be tightened any further 
i then decided to see what the grinder could output so i set the grinder setting to the finest possible setting without getting any burr rub and i was getting a grind size that was nowhere near espresso range  it was much closer to a drip setting  given that the lido e t was designed to do espresso this was a very worrying sign  i looked online and saw a lido   vs lido   video that showed both finest grind settings and it was certainly magnitudes finer than what mine got 
can anyone with an e t tell me what yours was like 
i   just making sure this logic is consistent this is a major feature for me and i don   see it being mentioned much 
ive only ever tried ippodo since they have a us based distribution center  their kanro gyokuro is the one i  continuously bought and have very much enjoyed it  but i want to try something new to see if i   missing out on other  possibly higher quality  gyokuros  so do any of you guys know of us based vendors that sell great gyokuro  i   trying to avoid spending money on international shipping since i only buy     packages of gyokuro at a time 
so i bought n    i  been playing through the tutorial and having fun  
however i  been unable to submit any scores or anything after completing an episode  it just said it failed and gives me the option to retry submitting  which fails   any other game works fine online and my connection is stable

i   trying to drink a lot more water however due to asd and adhd i frequently forget to eat drink and tend to not feel thirsty until i   already dehydrated  i   also trying to cut my sugar intake down to a minimum  
so far i  managed to almost totally eliminate fizzy juice  soda pop whatever you call it  except for if i have a mcdonald  or something  
i  been drinking a lot of low sugar flavoured water but normal tap water  scottish tap water is fine  tastes odd abs filtering it makes it taste even worse  i have an odd issue with taste   so i  been trying diluting juice  squash  with tap water but its usually quite sugary  
tl dr suggest ways for me to drink more water and ways to remind me to drink before thirst kicks in  also please don   say carbonated water it tastes like white noise

on one cutscene she was like  i   not of help on the battlefield but i can   just sit around there must be something i can do to help   so then she travels alllll the way to lanayru to pray at the spring of wisdom

i am new to pc gaming  i played on consoles from my nes til my xbox      instead of buying an xbox one i decided to give pc gaming a try  so far i have only bought games from steam  all of my games are relatively cheap >       i downloaded the tropico   demo and loved it  that game is     so i searched online and came across a website called allkeyshop   one of the sites shown has the game for under   euros  
http   www allkeyshop com blog compare and buy cd key for digital download tropico   
i didn   know if this is something i could trust or if i should just pay the    on steam 
if this is legit why wouldn   everyone else buy all their games for this website  
thanks 
hey everyone 
not sure if i   stating the obvious with this one but for anyone that doesn   know usb a bluetooth audio transmitters will work with the switch in portable mode  all you need is a usb c to usb a connector and you ' re all set  pictures 
i like this solution more than the audio jack connection as this one does not require you to constantly recharge the transmitter  
i tried it with two different types of connectors from amazon and they both worked fine though the longer one was unwieldy so i will be returning it  also the link to my bluetooth transmitter is below  
transmitter short connector long connector

puerh storage 
the recommendation i  gotten given my climate  desert climate  is to buy mylar bags and stick a boveda pack in there with the cake  my question is what humidity should i aim for with raw vs ripe  and what size boveda pack should i be getting for each cake  
right now i have each cake in its own mylar bag with a     size   boveda pack  the mylar bags i have  stored in a cardboard box  
hei cha storage  fu brick
i ordered a couple of fu brick with golden flowers  is there any special directions to storing these  i just have them stacked in my room inside the gift boxes they came in  i stuck a smaller brick into a mylar bag though  
brewing 
anybody have any parameters for brewing fu cha  i  just been treating it like a puerh  rinse once and steep at   s     should i follow similar parameters for other hei cha like liu bao  
on another note anybody have experience brewing cha tou  these nugs are super dense and it seems like they don   budge no matter how freshly boiled the water is  i was expecting it to brew a dark color since it  concentrated ripe puerh but it pretty much just brews a light coffee colorbag

question for the manual grinding folks  
i   looking to put together a coffee set for another family member this christmas and i   looking hand grinders seeing as the cheapest vario i can see over here is still over £     
working on a budget of up to £    is there a great manual grinder that  available in the uk europe that will produce enough coffee with sufficient consistency for a large pourover without feeling like your arm is going to drop off 
i do recall seeing a gear driven one before but for the life of me i can   remember a maker  name or cost 
hey redditors of the ps  sub i was wondering if you all could recommend a good headset for     or less 
my criteria


i only plan on using the headset for chatting with other players 


and if possible turtle beach is my preference   but it doesn   have to be if you can manage to find something better  


honestly if you go to the sodanibbas subreddit it is supportive to all us hydro homies  we should unite and call a truce to take down the reddit mods 
i brew only french press and moccamaster cup one   no espresso   as i understand it and correct me if i   wrong the best grinders for brewed coffee use flat steel burrs e g  the fortebg  the vario can be upgraded    however i weigh grind and brew by the dose perhaps       gr at a time twice a day   i don   need a grinder with a scale or timer nor do i need a grinder with lcd touchscreen controls   just one that will produce excellent and consistently sized grounds to the extent that it  reasonable   so what are my options for an electric grinder   i also just picked up a  zpresso k pro manual which i   going try out 
i know that it doesn   have a disc drive but the games are playable on the console and i bought them  why do i have to buy them again to play them digitally 
recently i submitted a link from my blog to r tea   my blog generally has low traffic so the spike from reddit was huge   as a result i have some good stats about the demographic of r tea and thought that i  share it with the rest of you 
most of you are american
    from america     from canada    from uk    other
most of you use chrome
    chrome     firefox     safari    ie and the rest is mobile
most of you use windows and android
    windows     mac     android    iphone and one of you used a blackberry  just one 
tried asking this in r espresso but got no comments so trying again here  p  
i  love to try a wpm pitcher and was looking at slowpoursupply but the shipping and currency exchange is just insane so i was wondering if anyone knew of any canadian suppliers instead  preferably with shipping but if any stores still do pickup i   around toronto gta 
i finally found a series x thanks to help from my fellow reddit users found it using hotstock got the notification when it dropped at best buy checked out for store pick up  got it a week later  so stoked    come home to set it up and it  not working  not sure if it had a bad system update or what   microsoft will replace it     up to   weeks to receive it  heres to hoping this new one will work  rant over  thanks for listening    
any tech person knows if it  technically possible to make your pc run your ps  games  i know it sounds silly but shouldnt it be possible to connect some usb from ps  to pc as a signal to your pc to run the game 
hi hydrohomies  i  just started drinking water in appropriate amounts and yesterday i drank about     liters  since then i have had the worst heartburn of my life  is the water the issue and what can i do to minimize this 
have you seen the hashtag #healthyu  an old friend from high school talks about her  clients  and then posts healthy recipes on her facebook  she never asks anyone to pm her regarding her weight loss or the other individuals '  before & after photos  all posts are hashtagged #healthyu and #lovethisprogram  i did a quick fb hashtag search and found other public posts with the same information   some posts are verbatim but with personal pictures 
i can   find any info on this outside of a partnership with the ymca and amway to promote healthy eating which doesn   seem to be related to these postings  anyone know what healthy u is

the sources i  found so far on how amacha is made however contained conflicting information  the process i think is most logical would be 
harvesting   withering   rolling   fermentation   drying
   which it is the same as the production of real fermented tea 
i found sources being more specific with the fermentation process stating    hours at   °c  however these sources also stated that rolling would take place after fermentation which doesn   really make sense to me  
there also seems to be no consensus on when the leaves are actually harvested  one sources writes about harvesting in august to october the other calls for young leaves just before the plant flowers 
i really hope to find someone who has some better insight into amacha production  thank you already in advance 
i am debating which lido to pick up and any help would be awesome  my main use for a grinder is espresso  however i do have a baratza encore currently which i would likely still use just due to the convenience  meaning my main use for the lido would be to take to work tk use with an aeropress v   or for taking when i go to visit my parents where i use a chemex  however i would still like to be able to use the grinder for espresso when i feel the need  
sorry for the wall of text but just wondering what you guys feel my best option would be as they are all basically the same price 
hey guys

i want to go the reusable pod route for our nespresso lattissima one  i have been looking at the different options and would preferably like to go for stainless steel ones as they seem the least likely to break  so far i am most impressed by the look of waycap pods

i just got my lido e on the   th and have already lost the plastic washer that goes in between the adjustment ring and locking ring  does anyone know what to replace it with  i checked the available replacement parts on orphan espresso  site and they don   seem to have that part anywhere

i recently picked up some sioux city and noticed they changed their bottle design to be lighter and have a stick on label instead of the more painted on looking label  i   pretty sure it also tastes different but i   not sure if that  just my mind playing some weird trick on me  has anyone else noticed a difference 
am i the only one that updates games at a relatively good speed but as soon as i update an app  like the store app  it just downloads ridiculously slow  i mean my internet speed is by no means super fast it caps at around    mbps but as soon as i update an app it goes to like     kbps  just curious to see if anyone else has this issue 
the first mention of this was about a year ago at thanksgiving  my uncles wife wanted to speak to my two brothers and i about some awesome opportunity  we end up in separate room and watch a video that is flashy  i   skeptical of nearly everything so i jump to questions right after the intro and take notes  she explains how you save money on vacations and recruit people to make money if you wanna do the business route  
 
i was told about having people below you on your left and on your right and i drew out hypotheticals to make sure i understood what she was saying  looks like a pyramid to me and i showed her  sadly my family is very gullible and the sight of some profit taints their view so i don   think the way i tried to talk about it swayed from being apart of this  out of my two brothers that were present one is just in college and the other is a struggling parent so i don   think they have money to invest but they are nearly sold on this  
 
fast forward to now and i think my siblings haven   bought in but i think my mom did and i just was so confused why  i   did very light research about this company and have seen some goods and bads and leaning toward thinking this is just another mlm thing  they seem to be trying to rope other family in and i think i should take a bigger stance but i don   know how to speak with them about this  i   know in the family for asking too many questions and being a downer and so i  like to hear our other tactics or just the important things to ask and help them out 
 
sorry for being scattered here  
hi  i      and have never played video games before  aside from quake    arena when it came out some cs and lol   i bought ps  recently and i think i made a mistake   i bought    games with it    
i like all of them and am mostly concentrated on rdr  spider man doom and hitman  but withe the job and home life i can mostly play this story games on weekend and on work days i play rocket league   
so to the question   do you play one story game at the time until the end or do you play multiple games at once   
i have a feeling like i   playing everything and nothing at all  an hour a day to go over rdr is nothing    give me some advices on how to game literally   
i have already tried that goya ginger beer that makes you cough if you smell it 
the only coffee i  been able to find that hits this note the way i love is counter culture  big trouble but i wanna support more roasters and explore other brands options  i   so afraid of wasting money on beans i   end up disliking  on a budget  which makes it hard to branch out 
i recently found this out and it was an … unpleasant moment of understanding to say the least
i am a fan of both the costa rican and peruvian regions  my preference tends to favor the bolder fuller bodies when i can find them  i have been enjoying the peruvian from modest for the last few months  i was really enjoying their costa rican prior to  but would like to try something else  
i  never ordered from them before but i am considering placing an order with freshcoffeeroasters com soon and these are the two options i have narrowed to 
peru sol y caf

hey guys mid year sale is live with a lot of great games on offer but if you ' re on a limited budget and got let  say     to spend then you should definitely check out ratchet and clank for the ps   with such a low price it  a keeper for sure  the game is extremely fun has pleasant graphics and plays amazingly

hi all my first choice for a budget filter grinder was the wilfa svart but i  been informed by a retailer that they likely won   come back in stock until january  i   now considering the baratza encore as an alternative but i was wondering if there are any considerations i should take into account when purchasing  i have heard people talk about upgrading the burrs so can anyone advise me on this  and anything else i might need to know   thanks 
this is the first smt game i ever played and i   having a blast with it  it reminds me of how i feel when i play dark souls  the mechanics are simple but you reeeally need to pay attention and make the right decisions because one wrong move can really mess you up  that  usually the recipe for excitement and fun for me 
i kind of wish pokemon would take some inspiration from smt  mechanics  ideally i personally think it would be better if nintendo can release   hard and   easy version of pokemon games instead of just   of the same game with just different content  this would definitely reinvigorate the pokemon genre for hardcore gamers older fans of pokemon imo 
but i doubt that will ever happen and that  okay because there  the shin megami tensei  series

i love water but i also love supporting small coffee shops around my area  someone kept hyping up blue bottle coffee and i thought let  give it a shot  i typically look into the cafes before i go to them to see how they source their beans  turns out the blue bottle coffee i went to check out not only doesn   actually re use or sells refillable bottles for use at the shop but it  owned by nestle  if you enjoy some coffee every now and then steer clear of them 
    and this one  definitely skittles right  i know we all thought it was skittles last year but this one undeniably tastes like i   drinking a handful of skittles with all the different colors mixed in  or am i crazy  
i have a few games in my wishlist and i basically am surprised when i find out i have missed a sale because i got no prior warning for this  why force me to constantly look at the e shop  
i mean i  heard some regions do get an automatic e mail saying that the games of their wishlist are on sale but this obviously does not happen in all regions  mine is set to north america   why is that  how is an automatic e mail  like what happens with steam and gog  warning when a game is on sale complicated for them to do 
recently got a ps  and while browsing games it dawned on me that almost every game cover is gray or colorless  they ' re either a little bit of color at the focal point dissolving into a gray background or completely gray  are we afraid of color  is color only for little kids or something  is color not edgy enough

heyy r hydrohomies i   aware that there are already plenty of such apps available  however i   planning on making this app as a side project just to exercise my ui designing skills with a particular ui pattern called neumorphism  i   attach some examples of this design pattern below   
it  a really cool minimal and super clean design pattern  imo   
so now i   here to basically ask all of you for certain features that you  like to see in the application  do you feel like current apps on the play store are missing a feature you would really appreciate  if so let me know and i   try my best to include it in the app i make

does anybody know where to get hi c  i live in toronto canada but i   willing to go down to buffalo just for this stuff 
and oh yeah please forgive me for even putting hi c in this sub  i   give you anything to forgive me      except my hi c supply 
i   really stressed right now  my mom just got roped into joining a mlm  she  all excited about the potential of making money  i don   know how to break it to her because she  very stubborn and doesn   like to listen to others  i   thinking about informing my dad but they ' re relationship is not good and i   worried that it might cause them to divorce  i even considered just letting her do it to not create any drama but i   really worried about her wasting our family savings  i   so lost and just scared about my current situation 
has anyone tried it  i buy the regular bkf by the case and just wonder if that one is any good 
i  been drinking hibiscus tea and another low blood pressure tea   chrysanthemum i think it is   to lower blood pressure   i dont think they really do but anyway i  seen a lot of good reviews on harney & sons teas and want to venture there   
what are your faves daily drinkers 
i love the taste of cream soda finding a diet version would be perfect does anyone know if it  around the gta 
i think i worded this question incorrectly and the buzzwords of  switch    and  playstation    are throwing people off 
my questions are more about the state of handheld gaming  what is feasible for the next gen nintendo handheld  ps  level of computing which seems like the answer would be no  that is too powerful to expect for the next   years  
something going into an ipad may be too expensive for a nintendo console 
then if some other chipset were used moving away from nvidia would it be possible to run switch games or would that require too large of a patch 
sony hasn   really made a dedicated fps and i  gotten tired of battlefield warzone and battle royales lately  and single player games are great  but i  been wanting a more social fps somethin slower and more deliberate  insurgency sandstorm has scratched that itch fantastically  
majority of players talk and the proximity chat makes talking with nearby enemies a blast  the gameplay is immersive and tense and every shot counts  roles matter  communication makes or breaks round  checking corners is key  thinking and planning ahead is rewarded  the maps are great  the gunplay is phenomenal and audio is amazing  and there  even dismemberment option for more brutality 
hadn   seen much talk on the sub so i wanted to make a post  it  currently     and has some bugs the devs are workin on  crashes have been reported so read up before ya by  but watch some gameplay if you ' re lookin for a new fps  there  co op pve and well as pvp  worth checking out if you ' re lookin for somethin a lil different 
i feel like there should be a name for this equivalent to al dente for noodles   
i have never been able to emulate restaurant barista quality lattes because i can never get the right strength  a good balance seems to maintain the bite of coffee while bringing in the creaminess of milk  my lattes either taste like milk with bitter coffee or too milky and weak  
does anyone have a method  
​
just something that dawned on me since wii u is confirmed at end of life and i can   see them going back to a disc based console  given that the switch sells decently 
i was recently in china and they had this soda lemon c  by shwepps and it only had    grams of sugar in it and it was probably the best soda ever but i cant find it in america has anybody had this drink or know where i can find it 
i have been lying to you all  i drink soda  i drink dasani  but worst of all    my pee is dark orange  i   sorry everyone i need help  i need guidance 
 f zero adventure 
it would be a game that explores the vast universe of f zero and the amazing characters that live in it  you would play as captain falcon and still enter races and the racing mechanics would be fully fleshed out as you would expect from f zero but it would also feature a robust story and have you tracking down bounties across different planets and would be open world 
i have a friend who was formerly hardcore into happy coffee and now she seems to have switched to  b epic    she posted today on social media about starting her b epic  journey    i was immediately suspicious so i looked them up   it screams mlm to me   https   www bepic com   index php page opportunity  has anyone else heard of this company or are they new 
i was just watching youtube on my ps  right in the middle of a video a message popped up saying i was logged out of my account and then above that it said i logged back in  it then showed that i was logged into someone else  account and i could view their subscriptions history and playlists  i closed the app and reopened it and was automatically logged back into mine  
not sure if this is some kind of glitch a security breach on my youtube account or a security breach of my ps   any ideas  who do i report this to  youtube or ps  
literally every question i have is answered by reddit within the top  rd or  th answer on google  
i felt like pcgaming and all the other  pc helpers  needs to be stopped in their quest to syphon as much money as possible from ad ridden sites that are posted at the top of google 
i love her to death but she just won   drink water and keeps saying it  not her favorite flavor of alcohol  
what should i do  i need advice 
i own several usb c devices  laptop smartphone gopro switch  so i bought an usb c charger for when i travel  
i can charge the switch with it on handle mode but it doesn   work on docked mode  it looks like thw switch doesn   detect the charger at all  i am not sure if it is charging slowly   i   check when i   have more time  
sorry for my broken english  
edit  the charger is the   w model
favorite sodas include root beer and moxie although already owns a book and hat about moxie 
trying to identify a soda that was sold at my highschool around           
bottle was a hybrid between plastic bottle but with a can top and tab  
soda was clear and so was the strange bottle  i remember flavors like mango maybe grape 
help  thank you
i   sipping on a hot black keurig coffee at work right now and it just tastes bitter acid like and gross 
so i started a diet where i can only drink pure black coffee in the morning  i was thinking a cold coffee would be tastier black than hot but i heard if you make a pot of hot coffee and store it in the fridge overnight it just gets more acidic and gross  so someone told me to look into cold brew which can be stored in the fridge 
tl dr 
so what  the best beans process i need to make a super smooth tasty and caffeinated cold brew  what have you experimented with  thanks 
my girlfriend doesn   play games too much but she  been really getting into pokken tournament  i don   blame her the game is a lot of fun so we both play against each other and it feels good knowing i can share some of the hobby with her 
what game s do you play with your s o  
i lost my controller so im borrowing my buddys but i cant go into settings w o a controller and xbox support is unhelpful
sorry if there  already something like this laid out  just trying to get away from basic common american tea
i roast my own coffee and want to make some for my brother who uses a keurig machine   i   have to grind it for him and i am not sure what size grind works best for those reusable filters   any help would be appreciated 
so i   trying to play swing mode with my joy cons but when i pair both controllers it spits me back to the main screen with   player selected and re pairs my pro controller  i am stuck  any help is appreciated 
please send me any links to solid evidence that herbalife is a pyramid scheme and just in general bad  she won   believe anything i say without evidence 
the switch lite won   affect couch co op as much as people think  it could make it even better  watch the release video again    when they were playing mario kart they had four people playing    people on the regular switch tabletop mode with single joy con and two people with switch lites all playing in the same race   the people with lites had their own personal screen and full dual joycon setup  for      it  more like a set of joycon with a      built in screen  sounds almost like a wii u if they wanted to implement a switch and switch lite that functioned like the wii u gamepad since most games can connect with up to   switches at once  just like the  ds could be a controller for smash wii u i  rather bring a lite to a friends house to watch my own screen with more comfortable controls  
this could be a brilliant move if nintendo played their cards right 
edit  not trying to suggest that everyone has to use the lite  screen for couch co op it  literally just another option to play in addition to all the other ways to play  i already have a switch and i   getting my boyfriend a lite just so he can have his own when i travel out of town for work but still play co op together without having to split a joy con 
i have the es  atm and i can   really play it a night because of the loud dpad and i play a lot of fighting games  i was wondering if i should get the es  if the d pad is quieter 
i don   like to recommend dlc rewards but it  better than not playing the game at all also gives you infinite hand gun and machine guns which are more fun on zombies 
i know some everyone will give up and go for a series s so should i secure the s or risk losing the chance of getting a xbox entirely for a x
yes i know that zelda doesn   technically use hd rumble and that blaster master does  however after playing a fair amount of blaster master the rumble in zelda feels more  hd  to me  finer details getting expressed in zelda whereas blaster master is just really really strong rumble  aside for the one part in the intro that felt like something taking off   
thoughts  i prefer zelda  use of rumble but am looking forward to a game that uses hd rumble well     switch is not appealing to me  
hey guys i  run through this game a few times  it  unlike anything else before with the glitches i found online 
[spoilers  ahead]
basically on my final mission to get some laughter  decided to stand in the bathroom facing the mirror slightly at an angle  on the left side of the mirror so i can see to the right side on the mirrors reflection 
creepy moaning occurs i choose not to move at all and jesusss i can see her in the mirror shes right behind me  i turn around     nope shes not there turn to the mirror yep 
anyway this repeated a few times and then i decided i wasnt having luck so i   end it in style but guess what i cannot get her to pop up anywhere else 
go back to the bathroom oh ok still can   see her unless looking in the mirror  
it  as if shes actually standing in the bathtub right next to the curtains 
great thing is i can carry on undisturbed lol    
just wondering if anyone has had this happen 
with my new console some of my games must upgrade to play in the console,
but they won    i  had   out of the   games upgrade but the others won   
when you try to it says installation stopped solutions   
it  one thing to play through a game and not like it and another to base your opinion on a hive mind of internet hate where most people haven   even touched it  i beat it recently and its an emotional experience with some of the best storytelling i  seen in a video game  the thought of someone missing out on it because of blind hatred  ironic due to the game  theme  is saddening  
play it and judge for yourself 
what  the connection you ask  well considering the u s  rejected tea blends  yes even earl grey  up until the     s there  a tight connection  this topic might not be for the purists but we really hope we did tea blending proud in this one  https   teforia com blog tea blending    
so last night i was going through my list of herbalife nutrition shops in my area on facebook and leaving a review warning people about what they are  i noticed that one of the newer ones that  not open yet had recently made a post about their  donut shots  which apparent  target stubborn fat around your midsection   so naturally i commented and just said  you can   target fat loss   within a hour that comment was deleted  i commented it again because why not  then the chick who runs the shop  big mlm hun  sent me a friend request  i thought that was weird so i declined it  a few minutes later i get a notification on instagram that their page for the shop had followed me meaning she searched me on there  also weird  but whatever  i look on that page and see the same post so i comment on that one too 🤣 i woke up this morning to see that the page has blocked me  i   feeling bold today so i might dm her and ask if their menu board is also gonna be claiming their teas  filter your kidneys   lol
eta  one of the herbalife huns responded to my review and this was her comment 🙄 here is the rest of the convo we had  afterwards she dm  me and continued the convo even further  i probably won   post that conversation but it was just more of the same ridiculousness 
eta   thank you for the awards  
has anyone tried brewing this with the chemex  any tips for brewing  i needed something really strong for my early morning long days  i   also a student so the price point attracted me to grabbing this over the other options  i typically use illy but i   afraid my budget can no longer afford this due to needing to penny pinch  please tell me i didn   make a mistake i   a coffee noob 
it seems consoles are starting to resemble pcs even on the outside 
so this girl on my facebook went from shilling itworks to some weird  q cloud  inhaler from a company called quintessential biosciences  i   currently trying to find more info about this company and it seems to have been around since       but i  never heard of it  has anyone else had any experiences with it  this chick is trying to claim that it  cures anxiety  eye roll
aren   they their own thing  how can they add them to games and what does that mean for a game to have nft   my stupid first thought is that there will only be one of each skin or collectible or what 
how do i make it more fun 
i got saints and sinners and i really want to have a good experience but the controllers and wires are annoying anyway to better my experience 
ps  lets you buy psp and psv games on it but for some stupid reason you can   play them on it  apparently they ' re just stored until you transfer them to your playstation handheld  i don   have one now but i was thinking about getting a vita soon to play several games i  wanted to play for a long time but couldn    and i   wondering how much of a rush should i be in to get the thing 
for example if i wanted to download daxter for psp or uncharted golden abyss for psv could i buy them on ps  now or sometime before the store closes and then get the vita sometime after that whenever i   able and download them there with no worries  or would i be screwed  or maybe since the ps  and psv store close at different dates if i buy a handheld exclusive on the   and then wait until after it  store closes but before the vita  does would i be safe  and then be screwed after the vita kicks the bucket 
and what about playstation   games like tomb raider or xenogears  or games on both ps  and vita with cross buy options like playstation all stars or sly cooper thieves in time  if i have them now am i free to download them on psv anytime  or must i hurry before the deadline  i never had a clear answer to any of these  that  why i ask 
so i just went to donate blood but was turned away because of an iron deficiency in my blood  i eat a pretty decent diet so i was surprised to hear this  then they asked me if i drink a lot of tea  i do for pleasure  never learned to like coffee  and apparently that can help prevent your blood from absorbing iron from the food you eat 
has anyone else had this happen  is there some way to counteract this or else how much do you think i need to cut back 
i noticed for me that i can   lift as much and that my arms look smaller  when i start drinking water my arms fill out strength comes back and my grip strength improves also 
my xbox series x controller won   let me use it wirelessly unless im right in front of my og xbox one i want to be able to use it just a little further i can use a type c usb but i want to use it wirelessly does anybody know how to fix this because i  never had this problem before 
found out today that my uncle  girlfriend has been charging over      mo to my    year old grandma  credit card for r f products  
my grandma agreed to purchase a few products out of politeness  she only agreed to a one time purchase but apparently the card was charged monthly for products that my grandma has never will never use  
i   livid after finding out my parents had to call my uncle  girlfriend to cancel the monthly charges  i   not entirely convinced she won   continue to use the credit card  sociopath behavior  
edit  since ethics fraud and elder abuse have been discussed in this thread i wanted to add that this woman is also a social worker  
the skinny of it is  final fantasy x fails to pre download on any sd card i put in my switch  error code           which nintendo support tells me is a vague error to do with being unable to write to the sd card  and the game itself is too big to fit on system memory   other games will download just fine   i even went ahead and downloaded double final fantasy x  size onto the sd card to see if i could get the same error but it never reoccurred  for some more details  ffx says in the store it requires just above   gb but on the system itself it is closer to     gb so i made sure to download   gb of free apps and games i had bought but hadn   downloaded    i  reformatted my card re set the card in the sd card slot restarted the console checked for updates and even bought and formatted a whole new card but i always get the same error in the        downloaded range   i   planning on getting a refund tomorrow and just picking the game up physical when i get a chance  not my preference for the switch specifically but i   bite the bullet since i  been falling in love with the ff series for the first time after years of trying and am very excited to see what the post ps  era has to offer  but i   just curious if anyone else has experienced this or even knows what exactly is going on   it  kind of strange 
​
 both  my sd card specs  sandisk ultra    gb microsdxc uhs i card with adapter      mb s u  a    sdsquar    g gn ma
​
 side note  the one thing i didn   try was a different model of sd card because i  only just thought of it  would that matter  
​
thanks in advance for any help information on prior experiences with this   i can   seem to find anything anywhere where people have experienced specifically this 
​
edit  for those getting here through google or wherever else with the same issue power cycling your modem and router seems to work 
edit  i reset my xbox and i got subnautica to work
i   getting into tea and i would really like a recommendation for a brand
i had a bottle of orange crush two days ago and it made my throat super sore all day yesterday  it  the only soda that does that to me  does that happen to anyone else 
i know that they are selling a new usb c battery pack but can i use the one that i already own from my xbox one controller in the new controller 
has anyone tried using the commander tac pro on fortnite  the tac pro was made for playstation     but i   not sure how good the gaming experience is with it not a lot of videos on it to justify it  if anyone has used it please give me the bad and the good on it  
this is in southern ohio    seems like cf diet dr pepper disappeared a few months back and now cf diet mt dew is gone as well   
where did it go    is it still around in other places    any way to get it   or get the syrup 
the product will be a smartphone with a special netnanny type app that will filter out anything that could burst their mlm bubble   no more haters hun   only toxic positivity allowed 
i   looking for   people to join my team   who  in 
my friend then pulls out a do terra catalog and lets me know that she signed up to be a representative for the discount  these oils are so freaking expensive     i knew then that she had been had  it made me sad because she  a single elementary school teacher in grad school who enjoys these oils  i perused the catalog but knew that i could get any of those oils on amazon for at least half the price  
bless her heart  
felt like i was betraying y ' all somehow but it was for his own good  
he slowly improved his sodium and we had to then treat the underlying problem  he will be alright 
the soda is so good  i first tried it when i was in italy and i haven   been able to find it since unless you wanna pay like     for   half liter bottles 
i  been looking for these teas for quite some time but every time that i see them i get nothing but extremely mixed reviews  i would love some suggestions on the matter for the next time that i can buy them 
i   in a bit of a pickle here  i   used to buying my coffee at a local roaster and their coffee is usually overwhelming me with flavor the moment i open a bag  i actually quite enjoy the experience of smelling the beans 
recently i ordered from a reputable roaster in berlin the coffee came in   days after supposed roast date but it had almost no smell or rather a very mild smell more akin to stale beans  it tasted alright  not even in the same ballpark as my local roaster but i know i   supposed to wait a week after roast date so the taste might have not developed yet   also the bloom wasn   as violent as usually with super fresh beans  i   really confused did they sell me stale coffee and marked it as fresh   should i complain to them  or am i just being paranoid 
update 
i contacted the roaster and their reply was  our coffee was roasted on the day it says on the bag   i was really confused with this reply since it didn   really address any of my concerns 
as suggested by some commenters this might happen with lighter roasts  so the only thing left to do is to wait a couple of days and see how the taste develops and if its gonna be better 
[theme spoilers ahead]
in almost every  what should i play next   thread on this sub i see recommendations for what remains of edith finch  so i decided to buy it and play it one afternoon  it was marketed to me as a mystery point and click almost as an escape room kind of game  
i finished in about   hours  but i ended the game feeling disturbed deeply unsettled depressed and unfulfilled 
i   already depressed in my regular life and i lost two close family members earlier this years   thank the heavens for my lovely therapist   i don   want the games that i play to mirror the worst parts of my real life  i want to escape  i want to parasail over hyrule become a cunning detective build a paradise island with furry friends or battle strange creatures  i  rather not spend money to make myself cry   i can do that for free 😂
and i know i can   be the only one who was extremely disappointed with this game recommendation  interested to hear everyone else  perspective 
i was in nyc for the holidays and discovered david  tea shop along with their matcha matsu which i absolutely fell in love with    where do you suggest i stock up on this   should i order it directly from them because i know that i like theirs already  i just started drinking loose leaf tea and now that i discovered matcha i feel like a junkie looking for more  please help me feed my addiction   also any fun information you have to share about match is welcome 
ok coffee scientists here  a question based on my recent subjective experience  
i tend to prefer very strong brews of coffee but recently out of politeness to my coworkers i  been brewing coffee in a french press and making it less like the grimace inducing rocket fuel i prefer which got me thinking 
here  the question  i  noticed that brewing with too much water  or not enough grounds  results in a cup of coffee that tastes weak unpleasant and generally dissatisfying  
however brewing stronger coffee and adding hot water a la americanos seems to result in a better tasting cup even if the water to grounds ratio approaches that of the weak pot of coffee mentioned above 
is there any principle out there explaining why that could be true  is it just me  
my mom joined primerica  it  an mlm according to the website shown on this subreddit  she signed a coworker up for a basic security system with vivint because of that she  earning      plus there  a promotion so she  getting an ipad  i know that mlms are supposed to be bad but she only paid     and got a bunch of licenses  security auto etc  
she goes home happy making a profit and her coworker is happy w her new security system  she  encouraging me to join  no force or pressure  and i   not going to lie i   kind of interested  i was wondering if people can remind me again why mlms are bad in the first place 
how do i report a player who shared my ip address to multiple players and kicked me off the internet 
hi  does world war z run at    fps on ps  pro or is it capped to     i   guessing its capped to     i   get it on pc if its capped 
thanks   
i  noticed that i don   have any  d platformers with a story mode so i   looking to pick one up  i   considering cuphead shovel knight meat boy and rayman legends but i might have to wait for a sale since the price went up on the e shop   i   looking for games that i absolutely cannot go wrong with as i   pretty picky about what type of games i play  it doesn   have to be a  d game or a platformer as long as i will get my money  worth  which one would you recommend the most 
motorstorm on playstation was awesome  loved the beautiful offroad maps the crazy speed you get from turbo the multiple vehicle types and separate optional paths some could take and the music was usually good too  fast and offroad are the most important parts for me being able to ride bikes would be nice too 
we want to give away something that we  created  a tea blend seems like a great idea 
where should we look for foundation teas and secondary spices  are wholesale prices something to look for with an order under    lbs  are there things we should avoid 
we really appreciate the feedback 
i know p t  has been removed from the psn store and i got a notification saying it can   be re downloaded    but why can   i play it even if i already have it installed 
i booted my ps  today and the icon was missing from the home screen  p t  is still available in my library and the status says the download is complete and the file size is     gb yet when i load it all i get is a blank blue screen  no text  just the ability to hit circle to go back 
does this mean no matter what i can   play p t  even though i have it downloaded 
edit  false alarm  i hard restarted my ps  and it  working now

am i the only one who would want a night shift mode for the switch  so the screen tints towards orange as the sun sets to make it easier to play at night reducing the blinding blue light  i use this on my iphone all the time and it basically makes my switch unusable for me at night  anyone else want to see this  how would we pitch that feature to nintendo 
my partner and i were in walmart yesterday browsing the better homes and gardens scented wax cubes when an elderly couple approached us  the woman has a diffuser in her hand and asked me  can you help me understand how to use this   i explain it to her then ask if she has any cats or dogs  she says yes a cat  i warn her to check with a vet about what oils can be harmful for cats before diffusing 
then she approaches    the hun  she tells us  that  actually not true  no oils are harmful to cats  i   a doterra rep     blah blah blah pseudoscience    and this woman has the audacity in the united states of america during the year      to pull her face mask down off her face while she is talking to us  after she  done marinating us in her pathogens and bad science i turn to the elderly couple and say  what i would do is just consult your vet as they have the training to best understand your cat  health and what will be safe   the woman says  i guess i   just wait to buy it  and puts the diffuser back 
not dramatic or eventful but    yuck

sigh  guys  i was the worst of the worst  my jamberry business wasn   growing like i was promised it would so i was looking for any potential avenue to turn things around  
one day in early may a local police officer was shot and killed in the line of duty two hours before she was going on maternity leave to take home her daughter  who had been very premature and in the nicu for several months   it was absolutely devastating to her family friends the police force and even the community  i genuinely wanted to help but i also saw that it was a way to get customers  
i ended up reaching out to the police force and asking if they would promote a fundraiser i was doing for the officer  family  pathetically i was not the first person with jamberry to reach out  
i feel so awful and gross about it now  the only thing that makes me feel a tiny bit less bad is that i was genuinely trying to help in some convoluted way and i would have donated      of my commission to the cause  but still  that it even crossed my mind as away to get new customers is just freaking awful  
now i feel like i need to go take a shower to wash all of the grossness out of my body  
i   a ~~water lover~~ hydro homie who is stoked on h o  sometimes i go on tangents telling people why water is the best drink out there  i had no idea this sub existed and i   so glad i found it 
or other  for me this is actually a lot tougher the more i think about it 
dmc v easily wins for bosses  i think the bosses are actually the weakest link in doom 
for everything else is where it gets difficult  
if this was purely dante vs slayer i personally think dante in dmc v has a bigger deeper more complex tool kit  but dmc v has a lot of levels not playing as dante  so for the entire game i   go with doom  but demon slaying as dantes kit sure is insane  here  the kicker though  doom on a controller is garbo  dmc v on a controller works great  so doom probably is more insane and technical but idk
so what  the superior demon slaying simulator 
[edit] i bought the game digitally and i still have everything   
it seems crash   has gone live for those who pre downloaded it in the us nearly four hours early   pre downloaded digital games usually aren   playable until midnight eastern time on release day  
so yeah due to covid i   working with a group of people working remotely   so we  decided to play something together  as a teambuilding  
we  tried team fortress     and we loved it  do you have more suggestions like that 
i   looking for something 

free  or very cheap 
easy to learn
low system requirements
more focused on our group  so like pvp or coop against the game 
more than   players 

any ideas 
i heard that battlefield   is gonna come out in      so are u guys hyped or not 
i haven   been able to find it for a couple of years it was probably discontinued but it never hurts to ask
i  been reading about coffee for a long while now but i hardly come by on this topic  hoping someone can give a few examples just so that i    and maybe someone else  be careful of in the future 
it  nice to see the megaman x series coming back into the spotlight but what about the glorious megaman games from inticreates  imo these games brought quality back to the megaman series and to this day capcom has not released an x style game that can stand up to the zero series  
problem is the only [legal] way to play these games that i   aware of is to purchase physical copies for the ds or gba  
with megaman back in the spotlight [a little bit] and it being almost    years since zxa and zero collection were released on the ds does anyone else think the time is right to bring these games to modern hardware   
this is the stuff
i found two bottles in the back of the bottom of a cooler at a fish joint i go to from time to time two years ago  my favorite soda  in diet  i bought them both drank them and have wanted more ever since  i  been checking the coolers shelves every time i go to a different gas station party store or retail establishment ever since  i found it on amazon     for one    oz bottle yikes  i found it on the faygo website a     case but     shipping  no thanks  i live in michigan washtenaw county but would be fine with traveling  can anyone help 
i realize the stories are very interconnected so i probably won   understand what  going on and will largely be playing for the gameplay  but it  free  
obviously subjective so there  no wrong answer i guess  i was under the impression that 
tall  racing
domed  fps
standard  everything else   
hey guys,
first off i   sorry for asking as i   sure you get this type of question all the time but i couldn   find an answer that really fit my wishes 
so i   looking for an rpg that is pretty long as i  got quite some time currently like most of you i imagine  i would also prefer a turn based battle system  
the thing i enjoy the most in rpgs is usually the upgrading aspect   character or weapon upgrades and stuff like that 
games in that direction i have played already are dq xi ni no kuni and digimon cyber sleuth  i  enjoyed all of them a lot even though dragon quest was my clear favorite 
appreciate your help   
edit  thanks for all your answers    i think i   going to check out the octopath demo first and see if it  something i  like 
dogurai  it was on sale for like      
how good could it be 
actually it  great  you mean  good  right 
no great 
it  like a stripped down mega man  each level is well constructed has a hard crux and a boss 
the story is well pretty basic  
and if you get good at it you can clock it pretty quickly  you can get the basic ending or search for the secrets and get the true ending  
if you have played mega man to the point where you can   go back again  at least for a while longer  then this is perfect  this is a sweet little game and even at full price of like   bucks  nz  is worth your time
a game popped into my head today at work i use to play when i was incredibly young but i can   remember any useful details  i   not even      sure if it was a sword fighting game  what i think i can remember is that the game had stages and i think you  v  against the computer killing the enemy advanced the stage where you would fight someone something else 
i remember a cheetah jaguar cat being one of the battles and a woman who carries a dagger behind her at the start of the stage being another one 
i want to know what it is so bad and i know it  a shot in the dark but if anyone could help me it would be super cool 
for me it would have to be the strawberry dr  pepper
just looking for a good site or subscription service out there 
so cyberpunk has made me really paranoid about the quality of ps  releases of games  so i got to ask are there any games i need to wait to play on ps  instead of base ps   i   specifically talking about in terms of visuals and general performance here 
personally i  only had bad experiences with naturals on the cupping table  i  generally found them boozy often accompanied with an unpleasant diesel y aroma   yet i recently had some lovely honey processed costa rican coffees with a considerable amount of mucilage left on the cherry and have been thinking maybe i  just had bad luck with naturals  any recommendations on origins that have thrown up some incredible naturals 
i am obsessed with tea and drink multiple cups a day  while in mexico a few months ago i discovered cacao tea which is steeped husks that surround the cacao bean  it was so good  not technically a true tea since it  made with husks and not tea leaves but it feels and tastes like a tea  delicious chocolate tea  anyways after i returned to the us i have been searching far and wide for this tea but haven   been able to find it anywhere   until this brand popped up in a google search  https   www cacaoteaco com  
has anyone else tried cacao tea and if you have have you ever tried this brand or do you know where to buy cacao tea in the us  i   desperate to find it again 
well i   in the process of getting my tea garden up and running again  i just wanted to share that growing tea was easy enough for me to do it on my first try in containers a few years ago  since then i  grown enough tea to have a pitcher of cold tea in the fridge at all times and hot tea     times a day 
if you can   be bothered to garden and have a yard at least pick a corner you don   care about and plant a variety of mint  i like the traditional kind a lot but i  also got chocolate mint and spearmint  it thrives on inattention and neglect and within   years will need to be kept back with a lawn mower  i just mow straight over the unwanted spread of my mint patch and it smells amazing 
something i have noticed a lot  i have seen a decent amount of popular people from my school now in mlms  they still have full time jobs and we ' re college graduates  because our school was one of the topic academically in our districts  but then they are now in mlms  also there  a meme that i resonate with   i may have been weird in high school but at least i never get recruited to a pyramid scheme   i have gotten recruited but not from them but from other people online or a former boss who was into arbonne for a hot minute 
there is a conundrum in that i love the nes snes era games but i   terrible at them  the ability to rewind at critical moments of the game is definitely the reason why i beat several of these games in these past few months  better still i can actually play most of them to the end without resorting to any sort of cheat codes  although i guess you could argue rewinding may be cheating too  
it  just a convenience that allows me to enjoy the games without ripping my hair off 
edit  aw shucks thank you kindly for the awards
i   choose two random people in    minutes
edit  ok  u aunty_fascist and  u fancyvelociraptor  check your messages
i   try to get some more codes from a friend  no promises
i used to be able to not tolerate tea without a ton of sugar and milk mixed in  i figured out that i was using poor quality tea in bags and decided to get something nicer  today i went to my local asian supermarket and bought a can of loose leaf green tea and it completely changed my perspective on how tea tastes       would sip again 
monthly discussion thread  previous what have you been playing threads

i  been using a pot of water on the stove i was just wondering if anyone had any tips i should know to make my tea better
man i really wish the old rumors would come back with two models with one being for the pro gamer willing to pay over     and the normal model  do you think theirs any possibility the old rumors might be true or showing up later on  i really want more power than the ps   pro comparison  what do you think  i  be willing to drop way more money if they had a pro at launch i know the exclusives will be amazing but i still want normal aaa games to be better on the ps  than xbox  i really don   want them to cut power just to make it cheaper so they can out sell microsoft  i think even if it was     if it was more powerful it would still outsell them  does anyone else agree  thanks for your time if you read all that 
i remember as a little kid i used to play dino crisis on my ps  and man that was one scary game  would love to see a modern version of that game released  i  probably owned every ps device ever launched since ps  even bought the original ps  which came with a ps  demo disc 
by nicest i certainly don   mean fanciest  i just enjoyed the nicest cup i  ever had and it was a post workout sencha in my garage  my garage is dusty and no matter how much i sweep it full of dog hair  it  used as storage a weight room and my dog  bedroom  she sheds something fierce   but sitting there with my dog for company and the garage door open the birds singing and the wind whistling through the trees it was beautiful  that was my most beautiful cup of tea yet 
i confess i have some norwex clothes and i actually really love them  but a few of them are on their last legs and i  like to find a good replacement that isn   an mlm product  i  like a couple clothes for cleaning bathrooms and mirrors and a good micro fibre hand towel for the bathroom  any recommendations would be greatly appreciated  please note i   in canada so some products may not be available or able to ship here  because apparebtly living in canada is the equivalent of living in some totally inaccessible place  but don   get me started on that

hi all,
there  a game that i played on xbox as a kid that i cannot remember the name of  i  been thinking about it for awhile now  he  what i can remember 
you play as a female
you start in a city that is sort of futuristic but at the same time seems regressed 
there  a section of the game where you ' re in a cave with goblins
you might fight the goblins with a stick staff
there might be some kind of memory loss amnesia aspect to the story  
as i write it i realize it kind of sounds like beyond good and evil but i can promise you that is not the game i   thinking of as i know bgae very well

my fiancee was just at an event for scentsy with her friend who sells and wants to join  as i was talking to her she mentioned things that seem very coached not of her normal vocabulary but that of other known mlms  is there anything i can do to convince her as they seemed to be pretty far in her head 
edit  thanks to everyone that offered advice  i think she is in a place where she sees how mlms work and has decided not to waste her money 
i feel like there is a million and one different mlm  around now and the market is completely saturated  plus the popularity of the anti mlm community and people generally just getting sick of  hey girl  messages  how long until they are phased out  i find it insane people are still getting roped into these things

so a girl who is part of a known big mlm shared this site on her instagram yesterday  the site offers a    week ‘cash injection '  to your business for the small price of £       specifically for ‘business owners '  who are struggling to sell their product   service 
i had a look at the website and to me it looks like they are literally targeting individuals who are already trapped in a pyramid scheme and are desperate to sell their product  
does anyone know anything about this site

i just got a puppy from a breeder  and you ' re supposed to ween the puppy off their existing food onto whatever you want to use  apparently the breeder is a rep for some sort of dog food mlm  which i didn   know what a thing  so basically i was forced to buy the food  which was severely overpriced  from one of her downlines   not even her   i bought a real small bag just to ween and that  it  
this doesn   feel ethical  i feel like i now need to buy something from a local real business owner to counteract the transaction  and i  basically ruined a self pledge to never support an mlm 😭
edit  to the people coming for me for going to a breeder i attempted to adopt but my husband is allergic to most breeds and poodle mixes are hard to come by right now and the one rescue i could find with poodles nearby didn   have any that were poodle enough to have reduced allergens  yes i agree adopt but that  not for everyone so don   come for me 
all i am a total tea newb  i started a medication that makes it difficult for me to fall asleep  so i started getting into a bedtime routine and now i   up to four cups of tea before bed  i really enjoy it  but so far i discovered i am not a huge fan of straight chamomile  i do like spearmint teas and teas with chamomile in the mix  i currently only use tea bags but i would like to be more environmentally minded  
so i   open to suggestions 
the obvious answer is  just dump it in the garbage 
i live in a country where we ' re required to use paper bags for our  food waste  meaning even slightly wet grounds will slowly leak through the bag  even multiple bags  and start building mold on the outside of it 
i was thinking of  saving  the grounds in a bowl let it dry out but i reckon it  start molding then too 
any help  much appreciated

somehow i was fortunate enough to get one at the end of      that has yet to break   however i wanted to play around with carrying how quickly new water fills the carafe  to experiment with fiber grinds   larger amounts of ground coffee  but i don   want to cannibalize my working machine   i   a huge fan of this machine  ability to equality distribute water across the whole carafe and too lazy to splurge for a moccamaster at the moment   
that said if anyone has a broken one i   willing to pay for shipping to see if i can poke around and experiment with it a little more 
thanks 
i  now finished all of the dishonored series and i gotta say what a phenomenal series  so many aspects of it are awesome  the combat the level design the art style the atmosphere the powers and abilities the bioshock vibes  the level design in particular is spectacular and is something more games need to take note of  having choices in missions was also really cool and makes the game even more replayable 
dishonored is a series i would have no trouble finding motivation to replay in the future  all of the games are perfectly paced with good length times that are short and sweet 
if you  never played this series than play it  now whens dishonored   coming

soooooo i want the new xbox as most and many people do but he  the issue i cannot find one anywhere but i have a series s  as of monday and just want to either take it back or trade it for a series x what should i do 
hi all  i work from home for about      hours daily from monday to friday and i   looking for endless relaxing games that i can play for about     hours per day after work while waiting for sleep to come to me 
i am open to practically any genre except puzzle games and acnh  all i need is something relaxing that doesn   take up too much  brain capacity  and can be played on an almost  auto pilot  level  i basically just want a game that helps me cool down after work and doesn   require me to think or grind too much or go on lengthy quests because my weekends are already taken up by those more serious games that i like to really sink my teeth into 
any suggestions outside of puzzle games and acnh will be appreciated  thanks very much 
for me    i would have to look it up since there are so many different kinds  just wondering also    
i am helping someone look for a new job

faxe kondi is a really awesome danish soda produced by royal unibrew  it tastes kind of like sprite but better i fell in love with the stuff when i visited the country last year    but there  a problem it is only sold in denmark & greenland anyone know where i can buy some imported 
i recently got a switch lite and my only issue with it is the d pad  when i hold up on the d pad it  somewhat easy to also register a left input  so in a game like celeste where i mean to dash directly upwards the d pad will sometimes trigger the left direction as well making me dash diagonally to the left  it  similar to the issues with pro controllers that i  played in the past  is this a widespread issue and is there an easy fix or should i just return the switch and hope for a better d pad next time 
it tastes like something died and was sitting in the water

so i live in north hollywood and i  called about   of the gamestops in my area today  every one of them essentially told me the same things  
   that they will have some available for walk ins without a preorder but they will have a very limited amount  every store i called made it seem as though they  have less than    and some said they  have about    
   they will not be ticketing or pre ringing the consoles at   pm like they will be doing for preorders  they said they will be selling the walk in units at midnight and that you have to stay there until midnight if you wanted one  and that leaving before then would result in losing your spot 
i just thought i would share this as i  seen a lot of information saying that gamestop will have a lot of walk in units and that they will be pre rung at   pm  this is not the case for my area but of course ymmv 
i see a lot of agreement in that people do not pour their beans in the hopper of your coffee grinder  i agree that it is not airtight but neither is the bag your beans came in once you open it  what  the difference here 
is there another preferred method of storing your beans  curious on what everyone  thoughts are 
thanks

whats up guys 
over a year now i´m reading all the stuff in the sub that was written about nx now switch   so after the reveal i questioned myself about the dock and decided to make my first post 
there were new rumors that say the dock boosting performance 
so my question is why is the dock that big 
remember the wiiu dock for loading the the pad  it´s tiny compared to the switch dock  in addition the switch one has usb ports  
so i believe that this is not just only a cosmetic design choice  there have to be more going on in the inside  i know the main power is in the tablet but i think the dock will improve graphics in terms of upscaling for example 
maybe you have some better theory

let  say you ' re in the mood to get tacos for dinner but aren   too sure where to go  so you ask your  friend for a recommendation and he tells you  king tacos restaurant   just a random name for example purposes  and he even has a discount card for you to use with some code on it  you don   think much of it just that it  a discount card 
before you go you do a quick google search and  figure out  king tacos restaurant  offers  customers cash back   say in the form of a visa card or some other payment method   on peoples orders that they refer  so your friend would be making money off of your purchase of tacos 
this raises a red flag in your head because this recommendation is monetarily incentivized  meaning your friend benefits from you doing business with that company 
if your friend is recommending you a place and he is monetarily incentivized that hurts the credibility of the recommendation because it raises the question  is this actually a good taco place or is my friend just trying to make a few bucks off of me  
my friend who i  been really worried about because he was diagnosed with low blood pressure  he just refuses to drink water we joke about it sometimes but the man might actually die  i really don   know what to do 
hey guys 
so i  had a switch since a few months after launch  i  always enjoyed it in docked mode but i  always struggled with handheld mode  
even when sitting it up and using the joycons free or a pro controller  
maybe it  because i   nearsighted but i find most games terribly hard to see properly on the tiny screen  such as botw hud  and even when something does click i just find the colors to lack the same life as playing in docked mode 
i really love my switch but i want to love it more… with the lack of a switch pro announcement i find myself struggling to play my switch as much as my xsx ps  pc etc… 
im mostly just playing it for exclusives these days so that  why i  been trying to get more into having it as a handheld on the go hoping i can find more ways to enjoy this console these days and get some more mileage out of it  
anyone else feel this way 
long story short i just have too many teas in my home  i would love someone to have the chance to try some out  i have a lot from david  tea and other random ones that are found in the grocery store  will send some examples if you comment on the kinds you like  they ' re not super fancy but i want someone to enjoy them 
i  like to not to spend      on this thing and i don   much care about the build or material it can be a chinese particle board desk i just need good room for my new alienware  i haven   ever played pc before i recently switched over from console so i don   have a desk yet 
i just recieved a new series x to replace my xbox one x  i   currently using an older     samsung led that supports  k @  hz 
i was thinking of picking up a new tcl   r    that supports  k @   hz and has a much lower lag time on sale now for a decent price  
to those who have made the switch was it worth the price and did it make a noticeable difference 
thanks 
use to be able to find the cans at every grocer and corner market now i can   find them anywhere up to     miles out   i can find the   liters and occasionally the     l bottles but that  it 
anyone know why the scarcity  is it just my area  did something go wrong the the canning process 
he is linked as main acccount on my ps  so i can play park because he has ps plus
if you  seen down to earth with zac efron on netflix you probably remember the episode where zac has a water tasting with anna kendrick   i  and a bunch of other folks apparently  contacted the australian company and they  taken a few weeks but have gotten back to me that they  sorted out shipping to the us  here   how to get yours 
hey all i   looking to upgrade my scale  i  used the acacia pearl at work and to be honest i   not that impressed with it for the price  currently i   using a cheap kitchen scale
i  like a scale that can do v  s chemex and espresso  so it has to be accurate as well as fit an   cup chemex
i  been looking at the decent scale selection and the decent scale looks really promising  has anybody used it  is it possible to do pour overs with it  it looks like it may be too narrow 
also would anybody recommend their milk jugs or other espresso equipment  if i get a scale i may go ahead and load up on some other essentials

i  seen some gameplay  looks pretty fun  for those who have it is there something about it that keeps you coming back every time 
hey all,
having an old man moment so you   have to bear with me   there was a trailer posted here a few weeks ago  i think  and it looked super sweet and totally want to buy it when it comes out but my mind is mush  full time job i hate going on interviews to find a new job i hate less hopefully wife is pregnant with our first stressed out  
anyways it was a game where you played as a shop keeper during the day and explored dungeons at night   pretty sure its an indie game  normally i remember to save posts i want to remember but seem to have forgotten 
anyways hope someone else remembers this and takes pity on a confused stressed out gamer 
i bought an aeropress about   weeks ago and today i got a sage bambino plus  since i began using the ap i  stopped drinking coffee sachets   my previous quick ‘go to '   
this morning in lieu of any other coffee my wife made me a sachet   and wow  i took a sip and thought  how did i used to like this stuff   
good to know that i   learning the difference already 
has anyone else had similar experiences with their palette 
which material is the best for my teapot  i mostly drink green tea and oolong tea  also what would be the perfect pot capacity for drinking tea 
hi tea drinkers of reddit  i   new to tea and have gotten a few variations to try from a local tea shop  the guide mentions the amount that a teaspoon or tablespoon will yield on the first steep and the woman at the shop said you can get more out of the leaves with a second pour 
i  tried doing a second go round and typically get watery tea even when i reduce the amount of water  is this typical or should i allow the leaves to steep longer the second time around  should the water be reheated to the appropriate temperature before attempting a second steep  do you somehow save your tea leaves for later 
thanks for any help  i am trying to get the most out of my leaves and not be wasteful   
i  heard nothing but great things about stardew valley from friends and internet strangers so this was a no brainer when i got my switch  i was worried this game would be a total time suck because i  suck so much time into games like this before  but when i started it up it didn   draw me in like i thought it would and i couldn   put my finger on why  but after trying a few more games since then i think i  figured it out  maybe 
stardew valley feels too open and too overwhelming  there  too many people to talk to and too much to do  and i don   really feel the motivation to really complete any of it  i recently also played littlewood and i  been enjoying that a lot more  i like how the game is more linear and the text is not pixelated  unlike stardew   i also like how i don   have to switch between tools  which i know is a common thing of farming games   i don   mind an open world concept but i feel like stardew just drops you in and says  have fun   it also feels like if i want to go into town things take forever 
i  also been enjoying cozy grove and animal crossing although those games can be frustrating at times too  but i think because there  some hand holding at the beginning it doesn   feel too overwhelming at once 
i recognize this is a highly unpopular opinion and maybe i just need to give the game more time  i get the impression stardew has a complex story and    maybe i   just not in the mood for that when it comes to life sims 
i have a condition called fructose malabsorption so i can   drink normal mountain dew  i used to be able to find throwback real sugar fairly easily but nothing in the last month   is anyone else still seeing it out there in the wild  i  even checked online but no luck 
so despite new super mario bros u deluxe coming out yesterday i have been playing it non stop  i finally beat the game       including post game stuff but not including super luigi u   this post may contain mild spoilers about some things so i   see if there  some way to tag this post for spoilers 
anyways one of the things you need to do to be able to get   stars on your save file is catch nabbit in every single world  now having      the game on the wii u version i  been switching back and forth between toadette and nabbit  now obviously if nabbit is being played nabbit can   appear in the various worlds with stuff he swiped  during the main story is was when i caught nabbit in world   that i was notified that i caught all the nabbits in each world     at the time i definitely did not do that  so i   bringing this up because this goes back to me     ing the game  despite it saying i caught all the nabbits i only have   stars  so i replay levels over and over again to make him loop through all the worlds catching every single one as i go 
to make a long story short i know for a fact i  caught nabbit in all   worlds he appears in but i still don   have five stars  for some reason i have run into a glitch that has barred me from ever getting   stars on my save for completion  
is this normal  has anyone else run into this issue  i doubt there is but is there some way to fix this issue 
ok so i really like pibb extra it  my favorite soda but i never got to try the original mr pibb but i have always heard about this soda called docx which tastes a lot like mr pibb but i have never found it and there is only   listing only one in soda finder and one on amazon but those are both more that   and i only want   to try the soda first but soda finder is    packs and amazon is a    pack and the docx website isn   much help either so can anyone help here 
so i recently posted in r gaming about should i buy a gaming pc and this one guy said that the next gen ps  is going to have an ssd    teraflop gpu and  really fast ram  and also the next gen xbox is going to have similar specs for only      which is going to have equivalent specs  supposed to  to like about a         gaming pc 
​
so do you think this is going to be the pc killer  i really hope not but i   going to have no other choice but to buy this next gen console if its close to       off a gaming pc  i need your guys help if i should even buy a gaming pc 
i  been using my hydro flask to take coffee to work but it leaves a metallic taste  i had an amazing ethiopian this morning that i made and it basically ruined it as soon as it was put in the hydro flask  any thermos recommendations that don   leave a metallic taste and can keep coffee warm for a long time 
here is an example of what i   talking about if you don   remember   granted i know the switch loads a lot faster and they would only be up for a few seconds but i do miss these from the wii u days   
hi  i just got a series x earlier today but i   not sure what games to get with it  this is my first xbox console and i   wondering what the best games are  also what games are backwards compatible  thanks 
not sure if its worth the     given i  played the original seems pretty similar other than the graphics
i recently was given a keurig machine and absoloutly love it   minus the costs of the cups  anyone know of a good discount site to pick up some kcups 
i know the obvious answer is to give up if you ' re not enjoying it  the problem is some games especially longer ones like rpgs can have periods where they ' re boring but eventually pick up again later on   
a recent example is dq     i mostly enjoyed it but by the end of act   i was getting bored   i quit and thought i wasn   going to bother completing it   eventually i did pick it back up again and pushed through the boredom   i   glad i did because it ended up being one of my favourite games by the time i completed it   
but with so many games to play these days how do you decide when it  worth carrying on and when you should just give up and move on to something new 
i grew up loving games but i don   have the time something like zelda requires 
i may be able to play for a few hours one night and then not touch the switch again for a few weeks so unless you  got snake oil to improve my memory long games are a no no unfortunately  i grew up loving and playing zelda and all the final fantasy games but time is limited now 
thanks for the recommendations 
a friend recommend getting some as it has many health benifits but when i googled it i only found one site that sells it and it was teabags without the twigs 
anybody know where i could order some quality stuff 
big fan of both and deciding has came down to which one runs better  
normally after four cups i sometimes get caffeine overdose symptoms    or if i drink coffee with no food  well today i just had a small cup of instant this morning  at home  with yogurt and then a second small cup  this was the cup from the shop     didn   even finish it    with a sizable piece of banana bread and it left me sweating and nauseated  not sure if it  just me but i get the sense that quite a few independent coffee shops are brewing their drip coffee too strong  has anyone else noticed this 
i  always known i didn   drink enough water but then i started intentionally being a hydro homie ,and these small things that used to bother me don   anymore  i thought my eye would twitch because i was looking at a screen too much nope  dehydrated  hasn   done it once  my sleep  awesome  aside from having to get up to pee all the time 😂 when i workout i also don   feel like dying  i feel so good when i   on top of my hydration  have a hydrated day my friends i sure will 💧💧💧💧
hey homies  i don   really drink bottled water we  got a brita filter so i need some advice  hurricane ida messed up the water in my city so we have to boil our water until tomorrow  we tried yesterday and it doesn   taste good so i   going to pick up a few gallons at the store to last us a couple days  what are your recommendations 
will nascar heat   be available for uk ps  owners  i  looked on the playstation store & it  only heat   that  available  any idea  
so a couple of years ago i managed to grab a secondhand ps  that had p t  installed for a fairly low amount  i was able to play the demo quite a few times and i loved every second of it  after a while maybe a year or so a lock appeared next to it and another game that came installed with the console  it says only the original user has the license to use said software  
my question is is there a way to play those games that have locks next to them if i get the original owner to allow me to use the software  if so how does it work and what would i need to do have him do  are there any other known options  i mean i already experienced the demo and i   happy i did but sometimes i feel like playing it again and it kind of sucks that i can   considering this was the main reason i bought his console instead of a newer model 
you know the ones i   talking about   all of a sudden a woman starts posting about her  fitness journey  and  never miss a monday  and how they are an accountability coach now   i know it  an mlm but how does it work 
i  tried that twice  they taste empty    but not bitter  just not satisfying 
i  always been using hoffman  method before that  i   on a new bag of freshly roasted beans but i use tap water 
i   pretty new to coffee brewing so not sure if i   over extracting the coffee  does this look like i   grinding too finely

long story short i was just discovering loose leaf tea when i moved to an area with a teavana  i got a job there drank the teavana kool aid was super enthusiastic about it for a while and then i became very discouraged with how aggressive and devious we were supposed to be to get customers to buy  i ended up quitting and now my tea supply is getting dangerously low  i don   want to spend the ridiculous prices at teavana without my sweet employee discount not to mention the fact that i don   want to patronize a place that is deliberately misleading their customers  where should i go instead  what online stores do you really like  will i have any luck in the asian markets in town  what brands should i buy there  i   be moving to so cal soon are there any good tea shops you know of in the l a  area  
thanks  r tea and happy drinking 
 edit  forgot to add what i like  generally anything unflavored is my favorite  i really love first flush darjeeling oolong and deep rich blacks  also a big fan of pu erh as i know it    but i  only ever had teavana  so maybe i have no idea what i   talking about 
father  day is around the corner and i   be adding a pro controller style controller to my wishlist  
the question is   do i go with the genuine article   or is there another i should be considering like a power a model or an  bitdo 
what non joycon controller do you like to use and why 
ps   i play everything so it  be for any genre but i particularly find that fps is hard to play via joycon 
edit   y ' all seem to be mostly in favor of the sn   pro  and based on your arguments i can   really blame you 
i was getting ready to back up my hard drive to be ready for upgrading to a  tb  i was only backing it up cause of p t   i then cleared out games to speed up the backup transfer time  i got caught up in the details of the process  used the  delete all   except fallout   and rocket league  option forgetting all about p t   completely feel gut punched with such a stupid mistake  yep i know it  just a video game  yes i know i   get over it  but depressed i   never get to share such a stellar mini game with any of my friends  as well as the fact that i   personally never get to play it again  
update  playing p t  again thanks everyone 
i used to love playing socom and ghost recon but it seems everything is strictly fps now  is there anything good out now or coming out soon 
how can i avoid encouraging a doterra hun  sales at a craft show 
i make unique lava stone jewelry the purpose of the stone is to be used for essential oils  i do not sell oils or ever give recommendations as i am not an aromatherapist  i have suggested to customers not to use doterra or young living as there are many other options available  i am doing a small outdoor craft show in a couple weeks at a family friend  house  i just found out that a doterra hun will be there most likely next to me  i am pretty upset about this whole situation i   absolutely disgusted with mlm companies essential oil ones in particular and loathe the fact that they are even allowed at craft fairs  i almost dipped out of the show all together but i really need the money and i hate to break commitments  do you have any advice to steer clear from this woman and not encourage her sales  i bought side panels to put on my tent so i don   have to look at her but i   not sure what more i can do  the organizer of the show thinks we are a perfect match which is so far from reality  please help 
edit   i appreciate all of you anti huns more than you   ever know  it  so refreshing to have a group of humans who feel the same way i do  i   a very non confrontational person but i reached out to the organizer and she  not going to put the doterriblebusiness woman next to me anymore  i also was able to find a very kind aromatherapist with a masters degree in science in my small city  i   going to meet with her tomorrow to get a stack of cards and some samples from her  she was more than happy to network with me  thank you all for the boost of confidence and some genuine thought out answers 
check it on netflix  just dropped today  episode two   stay hydrated 
i  got a very naive friend  jack   jack recently joined kyani and has been bragging about how much money he makes working for kyani being his own boss working in sales and marketing how great the product is etc 
jack  a sweet guy and hard worker but most things in his life were handed to him  we are decent friends but not real close  we are on the same athletic team and he has started trying to sell his product at our tournaments to all of his friends 
how do i convince jack that kyani is a scam  and should i try to convince him when we aren   that close and others have tried and failed 
probably been discussed to death so if this gets removed i   ok with it  love me some coffee but the business practices leave a bitter taste in my mouth  we are trying to make coffee at home more because of price taste etc you know the spiel  i try to buy the best i can without breaking the bank and am curious what brands offer the best values both economically and ethically

dandelions are the bane of suburban landscapers but their roots can make your coffee into something really special   to start out just go out on your lawn and find some dandelions   you want one that has gone to bloom   if you know of some abandoned property that  better   plants that have been growing for over a year will have the biggest roots 
now this is the hard part of this preparation  uproot the dandelions   this is very hard because dandelions have a long taproot which will snap off if you aren   careful   once you  got a good amount of roots clean them off and dry them thoroughly 
preheat your oven to     degrees fahrenheit and roast your roots until they ' re hard and brittle   while they cook a chocolaty aroma should diffuse through your kitchen   overall you ' re looking at about    minutes though larger roots could take longer   you must cook it until it is done   as they say  
once your roots are out of the oven and cool grind them to your preferred size and place into an airtight container until you want to use it   i usually try to make enough for the whole year as soon as i see dandelions blooming though i usually run out in late autumn 
to use your faux chicory just add about a tablespoon of your ground dandelion roots to your coffee grounds before brewing   the dandelion roots will give your coffee a bit of chocolaty flavor 
hey guys

i accidentally bought nestle water the other day  i   sorry  i will leave the group now 
before i was enlightened about water i was known as the mtn dew kid in school and hot sauce kid too but that part doesn   matter so i used to love soda throughout middle school and mtn was my favorite at least one day back then and it  been hard to not drink it for the last few months and mtn dew just came out with a watermelon flavor and i love watermelon  i think i  found a compromise what if i get one and drink it then drink   times equal parts water because i   at my wits end and i just want to know what it tastes like i  tasted every single flavor since the       and i don   like not knowing what one tastes like

does seltzer count as water within this community  if so does it have to be natural and not have an added flavor 
does sparkling water count 
also does water with some fresh squeezed lemon juice count 
these are the primary ways i drink water  do these preferences exclude me from being a true member of r hydrohomies 
i   not sure which to get,what would you guys go with personally 
before the new update the motion controls on fortnite would not be affected by invert y axis  now when you turn invert y axis on it turns it on for both motion controls and the joystick  is it possible to only keep the joystick inverted like before or was this overlooked 
they said they would show off what games on the series x would look like  they showed us that  k satisfied  i wasn   even expecting new games 
the only issue is with ac v but that  ubisoft  fault

for those curious why this is necessary windows store games initially were not compatible with adaptive sync and even had issues with custom v sync settings  microsoft eventually rolled out support for these settings but the developer has to explicitly add support for it  games not sold on the windows store do not need to have support added 
this feature is essentially an override for windows store games that lack adaptive sync support

there  a lot of love for agadio tao of tea and other great tea companies that we really admire in here but we want you guys to take a look at what we ' re up to at the tea spot so we  created the coupon code reddit   to get you guys     off on our website  www theteaspot com  until the end of the month  there  a lot to try so feel free to drop us a note with any questions about our teas and accessories  happy sipping r tea

i   looking for some semi recent rpgs adventure games to play that can be funny at times dark themes are more than welcome  games i  enjoyed a lot recently are  omori ikenfell swords of ditto turnip boy commits tax evasion and pikuniku  i try not to be picky and give things a try at least once or twice  but i really like bright art styles 
any of you use a percolator to make your coffee  do you have any recommended brands models  ideally i want one that doesn   require paper filters and is electric  though i  be open to using a stovetop one too   
i  been building and selling computers with a friend for the last several years now as a side earning  one of the few things that we have been missing is a large database where you can enter your hardware to see how it performs in different games  however afaik there is no single source for this kind of information 
so i  been thinking of building such a website  users can enter any kind of hardware to have to submit to the database as well as some kind of verification system to tag submittions as accurate  the database will include old hardware as well something that is definitely missing from the internet and is probably more relevant recently due to the shortages  
what do you guys think of this  is this needed  should i start working on it if it is  let me know and thanks in advance 
i have had my wii u for about   years and in that time i bought    games for it 
i have had my xbox one for   years and have purchased   games for it  my son mainly uses it for minecraft and games for gold and youtube 
i  had my ps  for    months and bought   games for it  
i  had my psvr for    months and have bought    games for it 
now my switch is just over   months old and i  bought    games for it although some are duplicates such as splatoon  mario kart and minecraft as my son has one too 
my point  if any is that switch seems to be making me buy more games than maybe any other system in the last   years 
the system i purchased the most games on is ps  where i have over     but they were purchased over many years 
my mother drinks a cup or two of unsweetened lipton black tea every single day and i  like to get her an upgraded version  i have a feeling that she wouldn   love anything too floral or something that requires too refined of a palate and i   also fairly certain she does not have a tea strainer for loose leaf teas  any suggestions  thank you 
is there an easy fix without having to drop cash on a new one 
anyone know if there will be a lego super hero   for ps 
i   moving to pa soon and have learned that i can choose my supplier in this state  my current source is    renewable or isn   able to state where their electricity comes from  i was very interested in ambit energy as they are able to provide      wind power at a reasonable rate  i have not been referred by  anyone but have only been searching through https   www papowerswitch com  for companies that have a green e certification  i was doing a google search of ambit energy to see if anyone had any problems with them and i discovered this sub  is the only problem on this sub with ambit energy the way they obtain their business e g  through mlm 
edit  i guess my ultimate question is  do you guys think it  okay for me to use this energy source as i think it is an overall good thing to get energy from wind despite the fact that they may use mlm  in my case i haven   been recruited by anyone and i do not plan to recruit anyway  didn   realize this was a thing until i read the faq on this sub  
i made a subreddit for people interested in mgs  on pc located at  r metalgearsolidv_pc   the main metalgearsolid subreddit exists and is quite good and i frequent it but i felt that subreddit caters more to diehard fans of the series and console players which i am neither  
with the release in about   weeks i think it is a good time to get the subreddit set up and get some discussions going  feel free to drop by and take a look or send me some feedback  thanks

i   looking for games that i can just pick up and play for like half an hour and then put down because i   a busy father with   kids while also trying to help my fiancé with our   month old baby  i was thinking games like hades dead cells or binding of isaac but i want to know if there are any games 
just got my switch last month and put    down on a physical copy of animal crossing  
it happened to be at a gamestop near my job  but far from my house and the status of our office closing is a little wobbly  im thinking the best course of action is to buy it digitally  just in case  it sucks cause id truly prefer the hard copy as it just feels more secure to me    
im worried about the game crashing and stuff tho    its a pretty popular hyped game and especially with the virus happening a lot of people have the same idea as me  buy digital  can the server handle it  am i worried for nothing   i saw someone on the ac sub say it could be a repeat of the joker  in smash bros   
how valid is this concern  should i try to stick it out for the physical copy  
 in north georgia 
i accidentally clicked on deer simulator and some cooking game and now they both show up among the games i actually do play  i hate seeing them there  can they be removed somehow 
i have read how popular pg tips is in england so i bought a box to try  i  honestly been disappointed by the lack of flavor  i just find it very bland  am i the only one 
at e  nintendo continued without showing anything of metroid prime   but out of nowhere released medroid dread the fifth  d of the franchise
it  the first original metroid in    years  this from a franchise that despite being loved and reputable was never exactly a sales leader  not even the prime
soon after the presentation metroid dread went on to lead the best selling game lists even with thousands of uninitiated players 
this is  metroid    and many will come blind to the franchise   even if the storyline isn   necessary for the game  still it would be interesting if switchs owners had the games available
unfortunately only two games are on the hybrid console  the nes original  which hasn   aged so well  and super metroid on the snes  this one however perfect   meanwhile on wii u the franchise is now leading among the best selling games with zero mission and metroid fusion   a remake of the original and the last original  metroid    both from the gba
we still have the metroid   remake this one only on the  ds
having said that  it  a shame that once again nintendo introduces a new game from a franchise without releasing previous releases  i would love to be able to play original luigi  mansion or have other  d zeldas on hand  unfortunately i haven   played windwaker yet 
the release of dread for me is another missed opportunity in the gba  or whatever the n    catalog of games  we  seen several times that franchises are experiencing rebirths and record sales in their launches on switch  and it  a shame that previous games are not yet within our reach
tl dr  metroid dread is the franchise  first original  d in    years  and while previous games on wii u lead sales on virtual console they remain unavailable on switch
just curious how other people deal with this
i recently bought a pair of closed back gaming headsets quality  great especially for directional audio for gaming
the only problem is i barely hear myself talk when i   communicating on the mic now and it feels like i   being too loud and i   not sure if i   being too loud
is there any way around this other than enabling  listen to this device   do you eventually get used to it 
hey friends  i   an enthusiast looking to up my game a bit  
i want to do some reading or watch some videos about the process of brewing itself and how the different variables in coffee affect the final outcome  is there a recommended book or website that covers things like grind size extraction time temp ratio etc and how they affect taste 
i   mostly a pourover guy if that helps  don   need all the nuance of espresso right now 
i know i   late to the party but i was really looking forward to play as a girl in the new super mario bros game  even if it  not peach i was super excited about peachette  
seeing the only girl character relegated to a permanent easy mode kinda took me aback  i don   know if i   overreacting but i hate that i have to give up the regular difficulty to play as toadette  
i haven   seen anyone else talk about this so i   wondering if it  just me  it  still an enjoyable and fun game this aspect just soured it quite a bit for me 
i enjoy my lido     but now i   making more espresso than anything else  can i buy parts to convert this to work like an e   eg to match the grind adjustment of the e model 
a friend is in washington currently so i was like hey surprise me with a bag of beans that  not starbucks  they ' re not big into coffee and my go to always has milk and flavorings  i   a big latte guy   however i want to be able to appreciate all types of coffee and be able to without drowning out all the flavor of it with add ins  i don   like cheap folgers black coffee i know that  how can i help them select something that they can be worry free about that i   like 
edit  washington not necessarily seattle
ok so  i joined this sub because when i started here  mo  ago my buddy was telling me subs to join and he said this place had memes about water and i was like  yeah sure why not 
but now  now i   striving to be one of you  i got off coffee this week just in time for my   th birthday  i want to go clean  no sodas  maybe some juice maybe some alcohol because i   sorry but your boy needs a sippy poo every now and again  no more caffeine and just water  it  not been a week yet but i feel this is it  i   done with the withdrawals finally and i   not buying anymore coffees at the store  my drink of choice was two or three starbucks tripleshot     mlg caffeine each  and i   going with just water all day 
i feel so much better already and so next i want to start eating better and start working out  after that advancement to the final boss  nicotine 
i just want to say i   glad y ' all are here  here  to the starting steps of a cleaner healthier life

simply put this is one of the best sodas i have ever tasted  the foretaste features a quick carbonic burn that doesn   last long  the main body has a rich pineapple flavor with a pleasingly creamy mouthfeel   the aftertaste echoes the main body of flavor and lingers a long time  i  drink it any time anywhere  it would be excellent mixed with rum  i   blown away by how good this soda is  if you can find some buy it 
just curious  i really enjoy trying new coffees lately and we only have a k cup brewer  it  really hit or miss on what  good  i would love to start a discussion on the world of k cups if anyone wants to talk about it or has recommendations  i know it  not the ideal go to situation for coffee but it sure beats what i was used to  grocery brand stuff from a rusty drip machine  eww  please be gentle lol 
every single time i start my xbox one i have to reconnect all the controllers via usb or unplugging the power cord  but this time the wireless will not connect period and the wired controller won   even turn on
i live in the uk  south west  our tap water isn   bad by any means it is drinkable but it does have this distinct taste to it that kind of puts me off    anyway ive been drinking bottled water for quite some time now however it doesn   seem to be the norm in the uk therefore people kind of scoff when i tell them i only drink bottled water  evian to be precise 
am i doing something wrong  should i feel guilty about drinking bottled water when the tap water around here is still ok  is there some kind of hydro meta im supposed to be sticking to

i bought this item at an antique store for     and i was wondering if i could get help in identifying it  it says  made in england  on the bottom but that  it  it doesn   have a whistling spout  it looks like a simplex but i   doubting it as it doesn   have a patent  can someone help me identify this 
here are some more pictures  http   imgur com a xduiy

amped and amped   in my opinion are the absolute pinnacle of snowboarding games  it was absolutely perfect the controls the feeling of  realism  the soundtrack  which i love but don   need in a re release   
how many of you wish microsoft would re release amped and amped   
i  never ordered from their site but i   getting concerned because i haven   received anything 
update  the game showed up a few days ago  i can finally see what everybody has been talking about 😁😁😁
we asap need a mod or game with mordhau chivalrous mechanics and escape from tarkov  instanced raid loot game mode 
please feel free to elaborate more on this it could be done a million ways   i see a modhau mod to br system being an easy way to test the concept   
a game that is not a shooter but has these brutal player loot and survival elements with a dynamic economy and instanced raids would be beyond anything that  been done 
got this sitting in my inventory so you   have to add me on steam  to get it just write   or   sentences on why you want it and why you haven   yet played it and the first person who seems reasonable  not just in it for a    to library  can have it 
edit  given away now  thanks 
i need help the patch version      of uncharted   cannot be downloaded because it says it is corrupted  any ideas on how to fix it  i cannot access multiplayer without downloading the latest patch    i have also checked if there are any corrupted files on my saved data in uncharted   fortunately i haven   found any  please help   
 idea after smoking a blunt what about we create a black ops   day to play and every year  i saw this picture comparing the amount of players that used to fill every single spot from the activision servers and i realized its really sad that something that was source of happiness for     of it  regular players end like this 
back in         black ops   was the only game i played for   hours every day after school for the entire year  i  made friends on bo  lobbies that still play with me today and i believe thats the case for a lot o people 
so i realized we could make something together in order to give a special day where we all can enjoy some matches of search and destroy on hijacked hahaaha
the day would be       the release date of bo  
🙌
let me preface and say that i don   seek out bottled water and my preferred source will always be filtered water from the tap  with that out of the way i think ice mountain is easily the best out of the cheaper store brands like dasani  overly minerally and kinda salty  or aquafina which also has an overly strong mineral flavor imo 
so have any of you guys tried using tea bags or instant coffee granules instead of ground coffee for the first few brews with a new moka pot to get rid of the metallic taste  my sis says it  a waste of good coffee grinds and that i should use the alternatives i just mentioned but the way i see it it  worth sacrificing a few brews for long term use what do you guys think 
i have a lot of gripes with how the e shop runs and how its set up but i feel like it might be beneficial to have a dlc section  i often forget that some games i have  splatoon   lego dc super villains to name a few  have add ons dlc so it would be pretty cool to have all of those add ons in one place 
i can dream 
looks good but seen loads of bad reviews around the game so far   
i get why they do the copy thing but come on  over and hour wait for less then a g update  they gotta find a quicker way to do this stuff on the ps 
i  had a couple before few and far between each time a different brand that i  never heard of  all i can find is san pelegrino and italian soda when i look it up but those are way too different  anybody know of any companies that have it

this game is running terribly slow and it still looking very bad and pixelated  i   getting constant lag and cannot barely play it  why is the performance on this game so bad  is there something i am not doing right  i have a good computer and can run games like skyrim on ultra with little to no lag   intel core quad    ghz  gb ddr  ram  gb gtx    ti 
looks like a great game so far besides the crazy lag i am getting

i   working on a video about rodan   fields and i was wondering if there are any ex r f consultants who still have their r f first steps business guide and product guide and would be willing to mail them to me  i will send you shipping     or at least snap a picture and let me know what these books look like and or how many pages are in them    
r f has always deeply bothered me for reasons i  not been able to pinpoint up until now and i would like to have access to those materials to make a point 
my tea tasted a little off but i can   tell if it  just in my head or if it has nothing to do with the bottle and instead has to do with the fact that it was no longer  fresh  
i recently bought a gaming pc but the monitor i bought only supports free sync  i didnt know nvidia graphics cards dont support free sync so i   thinking if i should replace my monitor for a gsync monitor  my gpu is gtx     ti and my processor is i      k  the monitor i bought is acer xg   hu 
edit  the only problem is gsync     p  ms monitors cost twice as much my current one cost me      if i   to switch to a gsync its gonna cost me     
i wouldn   be mad  honestly i prefer the retro design  what do you guys think 
it says it will be delivered by dec   th  i feel skeptical should i be 
edit  it says it was sent for delivery with a tracking number  should be here on the  th  feeling less skeptical 
i am a big fan of tim hortons and can   live without it 
i love the steeped tea and i want to save money 
i   about to buy a coffee machine but to use it for tea and use the steeped tea k cups from tim hortons 
what are some things i need to keep in mind and what should i need 
k cup reusable coffee filters are being sold and i   not sure if i should get this  do i need it 
it  usually like a picture of cash app with money in it and tagging their supposed up line then telling others to  ask them how   aka become a down line   🔺
just a neat thing i noticed  i used to always have a real problem with sensitivity to cold to the point where if the room was on the cool side of room temperature i  need long sleeves  i started actually being hydrated and that problem went away  one of the many benefits of actually drinking enough water 
im thinking of buying gta v on ps  but already have it on pc with level    so can i transfer that progress to ps  or not 
so i   like   hours into outer wilds and i   loving it  it  the perfect mixture of casual gameplay interesting exploration and story for me  i love that you can choose your own way and the game leaves you blind to most things but keeps notes of important things you discover for you to review  are there any other games that you enjoyed along the same vein as outer wilds  subnatica is one that i thought could possibly be an option 
i see a lot of people who claim there are no local multiplayer games this generation   in actuality it  actually just the opposite there  more than ever now  literally thousands thanks to the surge of indie games  a lot of these games have fallen under the radar however so after playing      local multiplayer games this generation i wanted to make a list of my favorites  i hope this list gives you some ideas on what local multiplayer games to play  check my post history for the top    of this generation if you have other systems  here  the list

my friend most likely a former friend sent my sister who she knows struggles with addiction and an eating disorder a beach body message  this friend hasn   talked for me in months and muted my social media not long after she joined earlier this year  
to say i   mad is an understatement  
feel free to vent in the comments about any experiences you have had with beach body 
i  made a habit of drinking water whenever i   at my desk  which normally is good but sometimes i drink so much water so quickly that i start getting some of the symptoms of water poisoning  like being dizzy drowsy stomach discomfort discomfort doing physical activities  and when i go to the bathroom it  clear as water  i try to go eat something salty to compensate and replenish my electrolytes but then it just turns into a cycle of eating and drinking  how can i better moderate my water intake 
i love motion control games

hi everyone,
i just had an interview with a company that sounded promising from the posting  their name is world wide events inc  i was really excited but when the zoom interview started  after we chatted for a couple minutes  he said that there was another person that would be coming on as well  i thought at first it was someone else who worked there but it was actually another lady also applying  this was a red flag for me  he did say the second interview if we were picked to move forward with the process would be one on one with someone who is currently growing with the company so we would be able to ask more questions and hear about what they like and dislike about working there  
the rest of the interview was essentially him talking about what their organization is about and the clients that they help  all of this sounded good  he also talked about some of the process and then said they ' re growing and need more people to come on board to oversee the operations of individual clients  this organization is works with non profits and charities   this part seems like it could potentially be okay but also a possible red flag 
he said that unlike a lot of places who don   offer benefits until   days after that they can hook you up with a broker from day one who can get you inexpensive health care but that at a certain point the company would cover all costs and all of the benefits would kick in like    k  again this seems a little sketchy to me 
finally he said there    options for payment  the first is a traditional salary that could range from          a week or the second option is a commission based option  i would have the ability to start out with the salary option but switch to the other if i saw more potential  
i pretty much have only had experience doing freelance work so this is the first time getting back into the work force in over a decade  i don   know if these things are actually red flags for an mlm but some stuff does seem sketchy  any advice would be greatly appreciated 
as a lifelong crash fan i double dipped on the switch release of   and have been enjoying it immensely  obviously going straight from the ps  release to switch the downgrade in graphical fidelity was gonna be more apparent to me 
honestly aside from the blurriness to the visuals  especially during cutscenes  the game has been perfectly fine and really well translated  heck the loading times are an enormous improvement when compared to the previous two crash releases   
however after unlocking the special n verted stages experimental mirrored versions of regular levels with a goofy filter added over i gotta say   the downgrade has become way more problematic  not sure if it  the zany filter visual tweaks or what that these specific stages have but oftentimes i find myself having a more difficult time playing through these  really ugly static fills the screen or the visual effects kinda stutter and get in the way    
not sure if anyone else who has previously played the ps  release also noticed this  hoping there can be at least a small patch to help smoothen out these visual gripes   
oxenfree not available with games with gold in india anyway to get it by changing region or something 
i don   understand how it works  for example i had to wait    days to see my playtime on warriors orochi    i don   care that i started playing it   days ago i want to see my playtime right away 
now i know some of y ' all have been soda free for awhile but i just was in a gas station and was about to grab my go to soda    but then i was like    nah and grabbed some h o in a bottle  
ive been trying to reduce my intake of soda and increase my intake of h o and one thing i have noticed is that the wonderful water tastes weird after i  drank soda so    how bout i just stop drinking soda  
anyway have a nice day
i was playing borderlands   and during one of the handful of scenes where one of the main cast of characters was fighting alongside me i was watching them do basically no damage despite being some sort of op siren 
instead they could have made her spew out awesome spells left and right like in the cutscenes and amaze me instead of faking some sort of teamplay by making her deal    of the damage i do  
well maybe borderlands is not the best example because she was phaselocking some enemies from time to time but you know what i mean right  there  plenty of games that do this  
increase the number of enemies or their difficulty to counteract the friendly npc being good at what they do so they don   just carry you 
it is actually a nice little gem 
and as mentioned before by others the takeshi castle  or wipeout for the uk  vibes are real  lol
just saw a post from team silent on facebook about sending your receipt to kanomi for an exchange  does anyone know anything 
a friend at work with whom i had been trading cheap style hair shoe etc  advice and aspirations for a couple years  discount deals were a fun hobby for us both and made for neutral work chatter 
one day we ' re at my desk discussing work and transitioned to chit chat after a while  she asked if i changed up my makeup recently i said not makeup but recommended a product that had taken care of some large pores for me  she complimented my skin and said she didn   see the pores complaining she  been breaking out  she was breaking out a bit but it really didn   affect her look  
she then asked if i  heard of r&f  she said she  been using a new regime and it had been helping her out  she complimented my skin again in chit chat also complaining about the breakout again 
   then she pushes the r&f regimen again totally ignoring the wal mart page holding the product whose results she complimented 
what kind of logic is that  she told me my product was working said hers was not then tried to sell me hers  what has happened to the world 
i asked her if that was  the one started by that terrible guy or the other one   she was visibly repulsed and said  the other one   she knows it  the same kind of company as something she hates  how does a smart woman like this contradict herself so much and not realise it 
i hate what these companies do to people  friendships  i hate she wanted to make money off me  i  given her a rich people garage sale find or two free off  does she now think i   a sucker because of that  is she grasping at last straws  so many questions and i will never have an answer 
miss that girl 
i wanna up my tea game and am trying to figure out which tea s  to buy  it should be relaxing not contain too much caffeine and taste good   
so far i´ve only tried some cheap white tea  pai mu tan   would matcha and some good white tea be good options 
i really loved the mercenaries series i wish we could get a third that has multiplayer option i think the rights are owned by ea and honestly let  not let them ruin a good game series 
sunshine is often looked at as the hard and frustrating mario game  it  worth keeping in mind that it becomes much less hard and frustrating when you make use of mario  full range of moves some of which aren   actually told to you anywhere in the game  
you can do most of the moves that are in every  d mario like the side flip and triple jump of course and those are all helpful  but there are a few other moves here that make the game much better 
spin jump  platforming would suck without this it  the most important thing here  spin the left stick around once quickly  like a zelda spin attack  and then jump  mario will do a spin jump   this jump goes the highest travels the farthest and gives you the most air time of any jump in the game  fluddless secret stages are great to use spin jump on  yoshi can perform this move too and his spin jump goes so high that you can drift anywhere easily  you can even spin jump out of a turbo nozzle dash for insane distance  you can also spin out of a normal jump to slow your descent  just spin the stick around while in the air to trigger a spin at any time while airborne 
spin spray  like the jump do the same thing but start spraying  if you spin and spray with no jump mario will spin around on the ground like a top and spray water in every direction  you can also do a spin jump and spray in the air for the same effect while airborne  use this to clean big areas and on the manta storm mission   the manta storm video posted by nintendo today where the player fails miserably is what prompted this post 
burst spray  do a full spray and then press a  you   shoot out a huge burst of water and mario will do a backflip  the backflip isn   very helpful so instead you should jump first  jump then full spray and press a while still in the air   you will do a burst spray without flipping and can keep spamming it quickly  it drains your tank fast but sprays out so much water that you can clean anything almost instantly  yoshi can do this too 
y look spray  the truth is there is almost no reason to do a  full spray  and stand in place to shoot water in this game  it  weird and hard to aim with  instead you can press y to start looking over the shoulder and still spray while doing it  this is way easier than using full spray aiming  you can also y look while in the air if you want to get really fancy 
slide spray  spray a little water on the ground in front of mario and then dive into it and you   do a slide that gains incredible speed  you can   turn very well so it  best for traveling long straightaways 
none of this stuff is super complex to pull off they just don   really tell you how to do it  it  no more difficult than odyssey jumps in terms of execution  hope you can use these to your advantage if you ' re playing sunshine for the first time 
so iv been trying to drink more water i use a large bottle and i   fine with taste and everything but prefer it as cold as possible but something i noticed is i always go one day off one day on any tips to help a bit more 
whoooooo what a rush  this community gave me all the gear i needed to respond to a hun  and she was actually interested in what i had to say  hopefully she gets out sooner than later  
i shared some of their income disclosure and how predatory they are and she was really surprised  i   still shaking in my boots a bit 
which one is better for your guys  
btw its a ps  controller 
final fantasy crystal cronicles was a really fun rpg where you could customize your entire party and fight with them through dungeons  the combat was fun for its time and the story was pretty fun too  the music made it imo
the thing thay i truly liked was the online feature however  i feel like that has lots of potential and a game like ff cc could do incredibly well on the switch  or maybe just a sequel  
i  even be happy with an updated port  or just a port  i   fine with anything as long as it  reminiscent of that game
the original game was on the gamecube btw but was ported to the wii and ds where it got online features as well 
so i had this xbox for like   months now and it  perfect but i can never connect my headphones to the xbox  i tried   different new controllers and updated the controllers and also used other pairs of headphones  where is the problem and how can i fix it please
so when i was like   i remember playing this game where the final boss in one of the levels was a head and or body on top of a tank and when he took damage he would like yell but it would be horrifying it was an original xbox game i don   remember the name or much of the game but it would be wonderful if y ' all could help out
it  technically the best i  ever played because gameplay and graphics are both     
new owner of a switch here  i loved x com on my old xbox and i wonder if there is any similar game on switch 
please throw me suggestions 
bonus points if it  on the black friday deal list

i  been using monat products for over a year  i really really thought they helped  i felt like my hair was better than ever  simply put  i fell for the lie  i was one of those ‘boss babes  '  i sold to my family and friends defended the price the ingredients the business  and when i was going through a super hard time through quarantine and pulled back on selling my ‘network of bffs '  was nowhere to be found  because i wasn   selling they took me out of the group chat  no one ever texted called asked if i was okay  
not until i was on social media talking about starting my own business  as a pet groomer so i  be a real business owner  did my upline reach out only to suggest that i start selling again to make the money to start my business  after losing connection with them i finally started to gain some sense  i noticed things that i previously explained away  losing more hair in the shower my scalp being so itchy  looking back it really sucks to see i fell for it and pushed so many of my friends and family to buy this product  happy to say that i   out  
that being said can anyone on here recommend some natural hair care  the whole reason i was so attracted to monat is they claimed to be ‘plant based vegan haircare  '  so if anyone has some good suggestions that actually work well i   all ears 
i am trying to pick a tea pot  do you get any metal taste in your tea like with stainless steel 
i am thinking about buying a    '  macbook pro w  retina display  how does a gt    m stack up with my sig rig       how do the laptop specs stack up against my     k processor  will my laptop be more powerful than my pc  any tips appreciated thanks 
i wish they add a feature where players could connect with each other using discord 
maybe they will add it in for the ps  but not all of us are fortunate enough to have one so hopefully they add it to ps  as well

sf story  a few weeks ago i walked a different way to work and saw a multi story r   f mural on the side of a building in the financial district  and have forgotten to snap a pic ever since   i was definitely surprised   i know no one here who goes in on mlms  
turns out their corporate headquarters is here in sf  i had no idea i figured they were like all the other oil n '  leggings sellers based out of utah  does california not have stricter laws around fraudulent practices  or at least way higher business tax that would discourage them from staying here

hey just had a thought that occurred to me while i was browsing google for specific solutions on nintendo switch consoles and as far as i   aware is there no diagnostic go to chart solution for problems with the switch  the nintendo switch has been out now for about   years and it seems like solutions to the most common types of problems with the switch are still unsolved  e g  black screen but console takes power battery icon but it wont boot  i  even seen console boots and immediately just freezes rendering the console useless   regardless i want to compile a list of problems and solutions that the community of nintendo switch users have experienced in order for me to come up with the ultimate nintendo switch diagnostic chart  please post problems too for solutions that you don   know of in case any one else has had that issue  i work at a repair shop and every time we receive a switch that has no signs of life  even after replacing common items  theres a less than     chance we wont be able to fix it  typically because of a drop  i  personally owned an original switch from launch and it has yet to have any issues apart from the typical digi lcd replacement and thermal paste fan simple things like that so i doubt its a manufacturing issue  anyways feel free to leave your two cents i   curious to see what other problems you guys have with the switch 
original post got deleted because i used  does anyone else 
second update  thank you all so much for the great advice it has really helped  i shut down the idea of her getting my address or delivering the order to my house and won   be giving her any details or talking any further about arbonne  i did feel at first like i was being rude but the advice here has helped put it in perspective and it  not rude to be firm and truthful  i   also going to return my order and just donate the amount i would have paid direct to the charity  
hi  i was at a local charity event at the weekend and ended up unable to extract my self from a conversation with an arbonne rep  before i knew it i was buying a box of overpriced fizzy sticks that will apparently help me focus when studying  she said the proceeds were going towards the fundraiser and tbh i   just bad at saying no  
then she took my details down because my order will get delivered during the week and now she keeps texting me saying she  going to call me to discuss opening a free arbonne account in my name that gives me money off and a free gift but if arbonne hq call i have to say i opened the account  i actually have no idea what she  on about and don   want any kind of account because i   not buying the products again  
i managed to put her off calling yesterday saying i was busy but she  really insistent  wanted to call me at      last night  and said she  phoning this morning  what do i do   i feel like she  being way too pushy and i   so uncomfortable 
update  it  all gone horribly wrong  i texted her to say i wasn   available to chat and would let her know how i got on with the drink things i ordered  she was going to consolidate all the orders from the charity event and deliver to where the event was held in town so i would have picked them up from there   i ended with  have a great day  thinking that was like a nice final way of telling her i didn   want to chat  now she  messaged back saying she actually lives near me so can drop my order off herself  she  persistent  i don   really feel like i can give a valid reason for not wanting her to come to my house and i know she  doing this so she can corner me face to face with a sales pitch

hey guys just wondering what your experiences were with wholelattelove com  i   thinking of making a large purchase but am a bit hesitant due to not knowing much about them  any and all experiences welcome 
i worked at my local shoprite as a cashier a few years back and after joining this sub it reminded me about one particular day there that i was extremely thirsty and dehydrated  i usually was a bit thirsty but that day sucked  it  pretty messed up that they don   allow that in my opinion so i thought i  share

i   a fan of sweeter shengs at a relatively low price can anyone vouche for      often or the      daily drinker from white tea  other sweet sheng recommendations would be appreciated 
i   new to loose leaf teas and was wondering if grinding the tea would significantly alter its flavor  i bought some teas from teavana that have some fairly large chunks of fruit that don   fit well in my tea ball  would the tea be more bitter if i ground up the pieces of orange rind for example 
my ps  is about   years old and about   weeks ago started lagging horribly in every game i play  rocket league apex legends fifa fortnite   i have tried most of my online games and they just lag so much it  near unplayable  i have been thinking of getting a pc but i have also been thinking about getting a ps  pro  i do not want the ps  just because i can only find them for near  ,    dollars and i am just really not trying to spend that much  
my internet connection is fine on every other device in my house  i am just very frustrated because i love playing games with my friends in my free time and it is not much fun anymore because i am always lagging and become a liability to the team  any advice or help offered will be greatly appreciated 
i   in college and my dorm roommate and i have been getting along well and hanging out a lot and have become pretty good friends  for a while she  been saying she  gonna get into trading in the foreign exchange market or something like that and i was impressed  i was thinkin  stonks  lol  then tonight she told me she finally paid to get in and start the videos and training and i was like hmmmm ok  then she started explaining how it  set up and i was thinking 🚩🚩🚩🚩pyramid scheme🚩🚩🚩🚩  i asked her what the company was and it  imarketslive  i had never heard of that before so once we got back to the room i went on this thread and looked for it and shocker it  an mlm  i guess there  a discount for it right now and she told me to tell her if i   interested  so i can be one of her recruits   i   not a confrontational person and she  a very defensive person so i   just gonna let things play out instead of telling her what she  getting herself into  she said she  let me know how it goes and she  really excited about it and genuinely believes she  gonna get really rich from it  it  sad to see gullible people taken advantage of but i feel like if i tried to tell her she  probably get mad so i   let her learn the lesson the hard way i guess lol 
woo  excited i found this subrebbit  i got into tea fairly recently and just began picking out what kind of stuff i really like so i have some things i   not too keen on to swap  
i have 

gevalia afternoon revival black tea
gevalia china mountain green tea
stash double spice chai
twinings herbal revive  lemon ginger 
bigelow chamomile citrus
jasmine tea from an asian food market loose leaf 
pic

most of these boxes are near full with only a couple bags missing  i   open for interesting swaps i  like to try a chocolate tea and i   really in love with zhena  sense of peace and would love more of that  flavored white green rooibos are best  i  also like to try some genmaicha  
feel free to use this thread to list your own swaps also 
my mom asked for  specifically  a k cup and drip pot combo coffee maker and i was wondering if anyone could point me in the direction of some reviews of these   i can   find many units even available  which may be part of my issue  and none seem to have a ton of reviews   
i am looking for the best unit under like      dollars   this is the one i  been looking at so far  
i love strong hearty black teas with bold flavors so i recently bought a small amount of loose leaf lapsang souchong  one sniff was enough to make me second guess my purchase but today i finally decided to power past the stench of stale week old campfire smoke and brew a cup  
i couldn   even manage a second sip  today i met a tea i could not drink 
he  always looking get rich quick things so he  quite vulnerable to mlm scams  he does one for a while then jumps ship to another and hears about a new  opportunity  and jumps to another  
he started with  as far as i know  world ventures  i wasn   sure what it was and when i asked him he used his natural salesman charisma and got me very excited about world ventures until i eventually thought  this sounds too good to be true   a quick google search said yes world ventures is a pyramid scheme 
he  sold some kind of  health shake  i don   remember the name of 
he  done a few other things that i don   quite remember any meaningful details of but now he is on a color street nails kick  
oh and last i heard he wants to go on another cruise after covid with his world ventures buddies  so apparently he  still involved with them 
and he wonders why he has so many money issues  i don   know if i   ever be able to drag him out of this quicksand pit  i love him and i feel bad for him and i   annoyed with him  it  a whole jumbled mess of emotions  
it  hard to spend time with him face to face or on the phone cause mostly what he talks about are his  business opportunities   no matter how much evidence i show him that these  companies  are predatory he hand waves it away  
i don   know what to do anymore  he  so throughly sucked into this

wow  i guess i needed to add  how to recognize mlm predators  to the laundry list of things to teach my kids  my    year old daughter is finishing college and beginning her job search  she mentioned to me that one of her basketball coaches from years ago contacted her with a great job opportunity  this is a woman who was in her in her mid     when she coached my daughter and of course all the girls looked up to her  my daughter has followed her on social media and they occasionally message  as she has with many girls on the team  congratulating each other on major life events etc  recently my daughter mentioned to me that she was worried about her  gut health  which sort of caught me off guard as i mentioned she is in college and i   pretty sure i could tell her what lifestyle changes she could make that might improve her gut health  insert eye roll    she told me that her  coach  has a great product for her to try and would love to catch up with her over coffee and hear about how her life is going  of course my daughter is thrilled that this person whom she has idolized wants to see her  i have told her what this is  i have told her this woman is going to try to get her to join her mlm and explained why her promises of financial success and freedom are not attainable   but mom coach is not that kind of person  she has so nice and she shows how great all this stuff works on her ig and she seems like she is doing really well   ugh  i almost want to contact this woman myself but my daughter is    now not    and it  not my place  any advice or input regarding how to help her understand what is happening here is greatly appreciated

because both my h  one and now my ocean shadow one have started to have something stop working within months of purchase in the current case its my lb after around  ish months so are they made with cheaper parts etc  because my original xbox one controller from   years ago still works perfectly fine 
so i got my lido e in the mail today made   or   shots of espresso and a few lattes  i didn   get the grind right for the first two shots but it turns out i  been grinding too fine on my encore for espresso  i just can   fine tune on the encore  anyway i  been able to pu some very fruity espresso  i just can   seem to get to the point where it leaves a punch of flavor maybe grind finer  though i  already got my       second extraction down  i   using filtered brita water which may have some effect on flavor  
apparently the reason she left because she found it too exhausting to sell things  
is this for real  is is possible to make money from selling mlm products 
edit  
thank you for the insightful replies  i found it hard to believe my friend as well  i had no idea that she was a mlm seller and while chatting i mentioned about another friend who is a young living seller   out of concern that she would be potentially losing money  it was at this moment that she told me that she made profits and it may be hard to convince my other friend to leave yl because she  making good money  
what y ' all said was right  she has a huge network  her relatives colleagues and other friends  her mother helped her as well  as she was one of those rare cases i believe it helped solidify her belief that mlms work  i sent her links to videos and articles but she has ignored them 
i think that in an mmo the voice chat would be too much to handle with a lot of people so how could people chat without plugging a keyboard in via the usb ports 
how many homies out here drinking water that is so cold it hurts but can   stop drinking it that cold 
i   one of those people who bought my first console during the pandemic after a life mostly devoid of video games   i  previously spent my free time with music and movies not so interested in sports or table games   the only significant memory i have of gaming is playing monkey island   and   which i adored  great dialogue fun to look at and listen to and satisfying to solve the puzzles which are mostly wordplay  i liked fighting games and racing games at the arcade when i was a kid but never had a console 
fast forward to last year i got myself a switch with breath of the wild and super mario odyssey right off the bat  botw was mesmerizing at first but immediately became too difficult  i got used to the combat but finding new weapons and keeping from freezing had me flummoxed 
mario however was perfect  charming absorbing great to look at  i never felt forced to stop playing in order to follow the storyline but the narrative was involved enough to give the gameplay meaning and there was enough hand holding to get me through without frustration  since then i  picked up  d world and as fun as it is it also shows how much more sophisticated odyssey is both technically and conceptually 
anyway i  had trouble finding stuff to play since then  i also played thimbleweed park which was a delight but i want to branch out and not limit myself to point and clickers  i don   care much for stuff like phoenix wright where i feel the interactivity is so limited i might as well just read a book  so while i value story above all i do want to be a part of the game at a deeper level  the problem is that i lack the skills to facilitate playing more contemporary games without hitting a wall of boredom or frustration 
i wanted to branch out into more immersive realism so i tried out bioshock and skyrim  i loved the setup of bioshock with its intoxicating colorful setting  why are so many other games so gray and beige   and its compelling enigmatic storytelling but immediately found it difficult to advance with fps mechanics  i feel completely lost with skyrim not knowing where to go or what to do and especially how to use my inventory  first person combat is a bit challenging there as well 
so my question is what games can i play that will develop my skills to open me up to more gaming experiences  i need to learn both dexterity and the logic of resource acquisition management  i  love to do so in a context that is fun and holds my interest  a good story a lively pace an appealing aesthetic and low difficulty would all help 
thanks in advance if you have ideas for me 
i drink diet pepsi very regularly  at  least  two cans a day  as such i know how it tastes  as you can probably guess i like it a lot   
however     
when i get the canned diet pepsi drinks  cheaper more easily recyclable etc  even though they taste their best when in the    oz bottles  i will occasionally run into one that tastes      well    bad  like it smells and tastes    metallic  flat  wrong  i   not quite sure how to describe it  usually for every    pack i buy  all with the same expiration date  i   maybe get one can that  like that  so less than a      chance of getting a  bad  diet pepsi  
​
anyone know why what this is  has anyone else experienced this issue with diet pepsi  i swear sometimes i feel like it  all in my head   
thanks in advance 
hi everyone 
in another thread that just got posted regarding msaa there  a post regarding deferred rendering and how it doesn   work properly with msaa 
i don   really understand the different rendering strategies  deferred rendering forward rendering deferred shading etc    i looked up an explanation of these technologies on the nvidia website but it was a little above my head  would somebody be able to eli  that 
 mods feel free to delete if this is too much of a  tech support  question  
in the extended superbowl ad it looked like two groups of people playing splatoon   on local multiplayer fighting the other group through online  if that true   wow  i wonder if that means a game could support up to eight player local multiplayer vs eight player local multiplayer  through online

i  read that the switch may use display port alternate mode over its usb c connection  of course there must be some propriety thing to tell the switch that it  in tv mode  but maybe that could be reverse engineered 
the reason why i  want something like this is because then you could plug the switch into your computer for video capture without having to buy use an elgato or the like 
so i have developed a theory aka shower thought  i drink room temp water and love to brush my teeth with hot to warm water  no teeth sensitivity issues just preference   my husband drink cold water and thinks brushing with hot water is disgusting  do cold water drinkers prefer to brush with cold water  and do room tempers brush with warm to hot water 
what is this and that should it be on   auto limited or full 
a few games i play stream tend to give me a pop up stating it doesn   allow streaming before it starts to work perfectly fine  star wars fallen order dead by daylight and among us and    minutes for example all say  this game doesn   allow streaming  before i start the stream or if i start it up via playing halo then switching to fallen order  
is this the case for everyone  what  going on

i do not have a sound bar just my tv speakers  but curious why i can   get dolby audio detected for any blu rays i am playing on my ps   even stranger it shows i   getting dolby audio when i   at the ps  main startup menu screens but when i go to the actual movie it reverts back to stereo on my tv  info 
i have my ps  audio settings set to bitstream dolby and also tried bitstream dts    doesn   make a difference  i realize i won   get the full benefit of dolby digital until i get a sound bar or receiver but i don   understand this  the tv is detecting dolby but not once a movie actually starts  i am getting dolby detected on another hdmi input for netflix amazon etc on fire stick during the playing of content

i really like the concept but the crashing makes it not playable  other suggestions 
after i updated to v     my mycareer gameplay on nba keeps freezing in mid game  already cleared the cache files turned off and on my system  but it keeps on crashing  
it  really frustrating when playing for   mins long quarter and the game decides to crash freeze on the  th quarter  
anyone know how to fix this   i played docked btw 
my ps  controller is only working when i point it at the console and if i put it on my leg  still pointing at the console  it doesn   work 
did anyone in the u s  have their pro pre order marked as shipped yet from amazon  my credit card is charged and the shipping date still said nov    but the status doesn   say shipped yet  it just said shipping today 
all i remember about it was,
it  raspberry flavored
it was probably caffeinated
it was definitely in bags with a tag
it was in a navy blue box
if anyone knows what i   talking about please let me know  it  important 
looking at the ps  xb  and even the ps  we were treated to gorgeous full screen art and maybe some music for a game we had selected in the menu and or started  but the switch lacks this  you select the game from the menu a short switch logo plays then the game boots  i kind of miss the full screen art even if it was just one more barrier between me and the game  thoughts 
got the xbox series x bundle email from microsoft a few days ago on an account i only used to purchase microsoft word 🙃  still had time to scoop both of the bundles up a few days later  be patient and your time will come don   give in to these scalpers 
i remember long time ago when the f e a r multiplayer got free to play and i finally had the chance to test the game out  it was amazing 
the feel of the weapons the bullet holes in the walls the splinters and dust that flew into the air when shooting random walls just for fun  it reminds me of the lobby shootout from the matrix 
is there any shooter that manages to capture that feeling other than the f e a r series  multiplayer or singleplayer doesn   really matter

i was really excited to grab my baratza encore to finally start brewing coffee at home in addition to brewing at my cafe  but almost everything i brew tastes flat dull  i  spent hours over the last couple of weeks trying to dial everything in for v   and chemex but the best i   get is a brew that gets a little better as it cools  
but i   not sure if it  something wrong with my particular grinder or if i should just drop the money on a virtuoso  
i  tried brewing the same coffees at the cafe using our commercial bunn grinder  g   and they come out exactly how i want them  bright n '  tangy  
a part of me also thinks that i   brewing it wrong each time but i  been a barista for four years and i   pretty confident with my pourovers   
tl dr  my encore ground coffees taste dull even after dialing in  same coffees taste fine on a bunn g  at work  wondering if i should ask for replacement grinder or upgrade to virtuoso  
in tetsu kasuya      recipe which is effectively   pours of   g every    seconds the sweetness can increased by decreasing the volume of the first pour    g   g   g   g   g  or increasing acidity by increasing the volume of the first pour    g   g   g   g   g  
why does this happen   what  going on in the extraction that changes the flavour

i was just recently referred to an mlm by an old supervisor but he never contacted me directly  instead he took my email and phone number off of the company computer and sent that contact information to a recruiter  is this illegal  i barely even interfaced with this guy and he  out here giving away my contact information to mlms  if anyone has any advice please let me know 
it  a legit game great story gameplay mechanics good open world exploration great ww  settings all is my personal experience  i know its available on origin and gog but why is it omitted on steam even though ea made moves on bringing their catalogue of games back to steam
i had discovered this subreddit recently and been gathering information about doterra  i  been convinced by friends i knew  from church especially  that doterra was the absolute ish  i went to starter zoom meetings i decided to buy a starter kit somehow bought more products and had been involved since about the pandemic started  march  
i started to question the questions about  who in my life i could share this with     having to buy something every single month was stressful    researching how oils shouldn   be consumed as much as people had been advertising    why i was allocating money in a pandemic where i had lost my job    if oils could really prevent those illnesses as advertised    making up  pure therapeutic grade     the supplements weren   having any effect    i saw a few red flags  but even my boyfriend  mom along with several other people i know has been involved with the company in some way  i felt it was best for me to cut ties with it though i haven   let anyone know i did  i feel a little sick over the whole thing i feel a little fooled 
also  nothing against essential oils at all  i love them and i will absolutely continue to buy them  doterra  actual oils are really nice but i want to find other companies with better prices and morals    and definitely not an mlm  i feel very silly that it  taken me this long  and the amount of money i have invested not a lot thankfully  but still not a little  but i like to think i   doing the right thing now  didn   realize that stress was as heavy as it was until it was lifted  thanks for letting me share 
update  thank you to everyone for your awesome comments and sharing your own stories oil companies you like  special thank you for the awards as well i didn   think this would be seen like it has been  it feels good to not feel so alone  you are all so great  thank you so much  means the world

my life motto is the same as my grandmother   she is tattooed on my arm so i can see and think about her everyday  she had some great sayings

yes it is grandma it  the best  i miss you  i will be drinking all the water i can until we meet again at the great fountain
i  been playing dying light on the switch for a few hours now and i   happy to say that it runs and looks very good the frame rate can drop a little when there are a lot of zombies on screen but overall i  been having a blast  
i  say the frame rate is very similar to that of the skyrim port plus the physical version comes with some nice extras such as a map and survival guide booklet 
so i bought an aged white tea mini cake   g  as it was the first time tasting it and i  absolutely loved and want more  and as i  been wanting to buy a tea cake from china i decided to try buying a big aged white tea cake 
i  found out about white tea and saw that they have some interesting ones  their  nightlife  seemed interesting so i want to buy their      patch as it  aged  
has anyone tried it  is it a good buy 
do you guys have any other teas to recommend 
 preferably under    bucks to avoid taxation and that can be found outside yunnan sourcing since it doesn   delive to brazil anymore 
thank you so much

my normal choice teas are various black teas with milk ans sugar  sometimes green and herbal tea but also with a bit of sugar  i find adding a bit of sugar make the flavour more demential  but as it  getting colder  it  snowing here in canada  and being home more i  been drinking more tea but i don   want the added sugar all the time  any suggestions on tea types or specific teas that are best without sugar  i   in ontario in canada so hopefully stuff that  available here 
are there any good places to sell a used xbox series x in nyc  tried to use fb marketplace but they banned my account randomly and still haven   responded  also tried craigslist i guess last resort is ebay but would like to avoid the fees

what  your story 
we knew we wanted to do something that would be unique and also had a concept of unity  we tea drunkenly brainstormed a ton of bad ideas before we came up with the notion of each creating a unique blend of sheng puerh tea that would be able to stand alone but was intended to be blended with the others tea  once we had that idea in place actually executing it was quite difficult  we tried tons of iterations of each of our blends this spring until we found the blends that really hummed together 
the next big challenge was deciding what to name them  that took almost as much time as the blend  it wasn   until i was walking through kunming with my wife lamu when she suddenly stopped and said  paul is  dog and you like cats so the tea could be like cats and dogs   genius  i shot that idea over to paul and he thought it was awesome so we put it into action right away   cats & dogs  it is  we created a visual design that works when two cakes are placed next to each other but looks cool alone 
after final design and printing we pressed the material into cute little    g bricks  it  really cool being able to try the teas alone and then blending them together   cats  is soft and sweet and  dogs  is strong and bitter  together they ' re a real nice balance  i hope some of you get a chance to try them 
anyways i love  r tea and appreciate the warmth and generosity of this community to both consumers and vendors  thank you for providing a place for likeminded people to meet  < 
hi homies the sub is open again  stay hydrated and don   spread misinformation 
edit  mfs already got weird as soon as i opened the sub up so i   restricting it for another hour
let  see if we can get this thing going

i know that the people who get sucked into these scams are victims  but there  a reason you say you can   con an honest john  when somebody is so willing to discredit the people around them and refuse to listen to data to profit off of their ostensibly economically similar peers  at what point are these people also completely responsible for what  happening to them  how many times do they have to believe that everyone is out to get them before the problem is them 
if somebody told me the company i was working for was a scam i would check it out period but i could understand why some people might not  but if the company that i was working for was a scam and required me to recruit my family and friends  i would be horrified and diving into research the minute that i heard any feedback about it potentially being a scam  that  because i care about my family and friends and the idea of potentially hurting them is worse than the idea of losing money  that  clearly not true for anyone who  joined an mlm  just a thought
i don   understand  they could actually make money even if it  minimum wage answering calls for      flowers they would still be making way more than the mlm by not losing money and going into debt and maybe making   dollars a month  they would also get to be home with their children  they wouldn   have to alienate friends and family either 
or of course a littler better perhaps teas that lend themselves to the self packing k cup things well at the specific temps and stuff the keurig uses 
the tea tasted fine at first  but then i noticed an odd aftertaste similar to chewing on styrofoam now i had descaled my zojirushi the day before so the flavor wasn   limescale  i don   know if something was up with my mug or gaiwan or pitcher or what 
more details in my blog post on how i brewed it

a couple of weeks ago at work i commented  cute duster  to my manager   to which she replied  her name is sarah   😐😐 then today i go up to her to ask a question and she  smearing on some lipsense gloss  i made zero mention of it   i don   want to know if she  a retailer   
okay so i  been wanting an xbox for a while and my friend recommended i should get one too but i   stuck in a decision  should i get the series s now or save up to get the series x  can someone tell me the pros and cons and if i should save up for a month to get the series x i   thinking of getting the series x but i wanna know the pros and cons before i purchase  thanks 
a girl i used to work with and i follow each other on instagram  she was super nice and i liked her a lot but she moved to another state a little while back  she dm  me yesterday on instagram and when i opened it it was a paragraph asking if she can share with me about her new side hustle  the paragraph was very contrived especially since she hasn   bothered to message me for anything else since she moved  the more i type this the more i feel i should just leave her on  seen   i just feel bad because i actually knew her and she was one of the nicest people  anyone else find themselves in this situation  if it was some random person i would simply block them or tell them i   not interested in their scammy product or whatever  it  just tough with me to be so frank with people i actually knew and liked 
i want to make a tea discord server just so i can discuss tea live with other people  i won   make the server unless anyone  interested or if it already exists  i appreciate your input in advance 
edit  already exists  thanks guys 
edit    well now i just feel silly  turns out all tea related online communications are on this sub  wiki page including irc servers for which i   also excited 
if so any suggestions where the best place to do it is  i found   cans of mt  dew sangrita blast that a former coworker left behind in a drawer  looks like there are a few listings on ebay but who knows if those actually sell  any suggestions would be great 
i think i have water intoxication  being a  hydrohomie is cool but sometimes too much water is not good  i drink about     normal sized water bottles a day  this is not good  even after i drink some i   still thirsty  i   only    so i don   need that much water  help 
so i   currently going to school and i live pretty far from my extended family  a few weeks ago one of my favorite cousins sent me a facebook message saying she would be a few hours away from my college for a work seminar and that i should drive up and join her for the afternoon  i was pretty excited  i hadn   seen her in at least two years  i took the day off work filled my gas tank and drove almost two hours  in a rainstorm  to see my cousin and her husband  my mom met us there  it was a two hour drive for her as well  
when i arrived they had already eaten  whatever no big deal  it wasn   really about the lunch anyway it  about seeing family  i grabbed a sandwich from down the street and met them in their hotel lobby  as i started looking around i noticed it     primerica bags everywhere  people lined up waiting to check in were decked out in primerica gear from head to toe  
after having only chatted for about five minutes my cousin declared how excited she was to  share  her new business with us  i listened for close to forty minutes as she tried to convince my mom to sign up  it took everything i had not to call her out then and there but i knew my mom  feelings would be crushed   don   worry she  not buying anything  
honestly it hurt my feelings  and my wallet  i had to take the whole day off plus gas money which meant i lost at least      for the day  i   a grad student working two jobs so that money means a lot to me  it  well worth spending time with family but not if that family member only sees you as a potential client  
also the things she was saying were creepy very cult like  she promised my mom that she would be making     ,    next year and that she was really changing people  lives for the better  she also told us that she goes to these conferences every month sometimes more often than that  if they ' re paying for hotels a van rental food conference fees etc how can she not see that they ' re losing money   
working from home  this past year i  switched from coffee to tea   my go to is twinnings irish breakfast   usually drink it no cream or sugar but occasionally add a tiny bit of brown sugar   i do drink other teas but irish breakfasts tend to be my preferred hot morning cup   im wondering if i should step up my game or explore other brands   i doubt twinning is the best but i don   know   i am equipped for loose leaf but im also lazy and bags are easier 
 i   do iced teas with greens chais or mints 
looking to get a rocket appartamento espresso machine and i already have a baratza virtuoso that i use for pour overs  can i get away making good espresso with the virtuoso or should i upgrade  i would looooove to get a grinder that could grind for pour overs and espresso

so i recently started selling an american treats box and i  posted it on imgur and picked up a lot of hate for my choice of soda to put in the box  as i   from the uk i didn   really know what to get so i got faygo grape  i  heard of it and it was the cheaper option i   wishing i researched it before now  i also knew it was unique and couldn   just be bought in the uk like coca cola  so what i   asking is what soda should i pick

hey everyone  i  been lurking this subreddit for some months now and thanks to all your informative posts i  learnt so much about mlm and the companies i need to avoid  i think i  grown a lot wiser reading them so thank you 
my boyfriend is one who likes to spring random surprises on me by gifting me stuff he thinks would be useful  today he did it again but this time with a nu skin product he bought from his colleague  because according to him many of his other colleagues placed orders with her so he was under the impression that the product was good but when i probed further he admitted that that they were first time users as well   
now he knows that i  been reading this subreddit a lot and i  also been occasionally educating him what i read here xd so when i saw the  nu skin   brand on the packaging mlm immediately came to mind  his face when i exclaimed that this is by an mlm company was priceless  the product in question is the ap   whitening fluoride toothpaste 
he showed me a fb status by the peddler promoting the product  in an attempt to stop my nagging  and it was filled with her  friends  claiming that it  the best toothpaste ever  i think that was also how he got tempted to get it for me because i  got pretty sensitive teeth 
now the question  i don   wanna waste his money  pretty sure he paid quite a lot for it because he refused to disclose how much he spent on it for fear that i  nag more  so i would like to find out how effective this toothpaste is  anyone tried it and got undesirable results  i   putting it on hold for now because i don   really trust anything by mlms and as mentioned my teeth are quite sensitive  to hot and cold  
any feedback is appreciated  thanks 
tldr  op wants to gather reviews on nu skin  whitening fluoride toothpaste before she applies it to her sensitive teeth

i recently started drinking matcha for both the health and taste benefits and started with poorly researched purchases from amazon  akira and encha   today i received the tin of ummon that i ordered from ippodo for a comparison and i am blown away by the taste the quality and the difference in physiological response energy that i get out of it 
with that said i   looking for a daily drinking matcha  i drink usucha with nothing added to it usually two to three times per day  i  read other threads with recommendations and i have some aoarashi and isuzu coming from marukyu koyamaen  courtesy of sazen  to try but i wanted to check here to see if there are any recommendations for a good daily drinker to keep on hand considering that i   likely to go through about   g every two weeks or so 
my current list of possibilities is as follows 
aoarashi isuzu wako  marukyu 
kan no shiro sayaka no mukashi  ippodo 
the sayaka would be a bit of a budgetary stretch   i   looking for that price point or lower   but i really like the way that the ummon is feeling in terms of energy and the taste was great so that leads me to strongly consider ippodo  any thoughts or insights would be greatly appreciated and thanks to all of you in advance 
is it simply carbonation that makes a soda a soda  or does it have to do with syrups and other ingredients  i   genuinely curious 
curious if anyone has any insights  my sister told me about a game she was interested and i wanted to surprise her by gifting it to her  when she redeemed it we noticed it said it was only for series x   s and we each only have an xbox one 
i submitted a refund request but microsoft says they will not refund it  clearly neither of us have the correct console for the game  has anyone encountered this  i   going to call them shortly when i get a moment but i was confused  maybe i  been spoiled by how well steam treats refunds 
i used to be a hardcore soda addict so there was no way i could just jump straight to water but sparkling water like la croix and topo chico have been pretty enjoyable 
an anon reader of my facebook page reached out to me with this information 
​

  looks like llr is allowing retailers to order but not fulfilling their orders  credits are in build prior to the retailers getting their product  taking their cash and giving credit   not refunding their cash  shady   

​
comment from lularoe fail  the warehouse knows exactly how many items they have in stock at one time   that  what warehouse inventory management systems are for  yet lularoe is taking money knowing that they cannot fulfill orders for these specific pieces and not issuing refunds only back office credits 
​
if this has happened to you you need to file a complaint with the ftc  this is against ftc regulations  see here  http   links lularoefail com ftcregs

been feeling burnt out on action games  any recommendations for chill simulation management games  looking for something lighthearted like ooblets  pc  or maybe something like managing a farm restaurant city or something of the sort 
i  already had hours sunk into animal crossing and stardew valley so i  like recommendations outside of that please 
currently have my sights on spiritfarer and or littlewood but i   not sure if either of these are what i should go for or if there are other better options  maybe even a game with a tamagotchi like gameplay maybe  idk but yeah a short sweet simulation management to cleanse my pallet would be great 
hey guys hope you ' re all well 
with the amount of free games we got this month i can only apologise for these  reviews  but i still think it  worth doing them to try and convince people to play them   
 
so this one is called invisible inc 
it  a game by the people who brought us don   starve  amazing game but nothing like this one  
the only easy way i can describe it is by saying that it  like a stealthy transistor which means it is turn based and you have to follow a grid  not my usual type of game but it  always worth trying 
 
the first level tutorial didn   seem very insightful for me but i   useless at these games so it could have been down to that  but some of the icons were offset on the screen so it took me a while to see them 
that  not so much of a problem though and the rest of the level seemed fairly straight forward   after watching it back and realising i was being foolish 
there are a few mechanics that i saw early on such as 

hacking of systems to turn off alarms and control cameras 
taking down enemies even whilst it  their turn 
using  ingocnita  to show what you can interact with in the level 

 
but after reading the website description it seems that the levels after this one are randomly generated which makes this much more appealing 
 
all in all it was alright but like i say not my sort of game really 
 
has anyone else tried it  if so what did you think of it 
short gameplay for anyone interested in seeing the first level

in recent months we have had a number of requests to allow tea products containing cbd to be posted in our marketing monday thread   up to this point we have prohibited such posts based on rule #  regarding controlled substances   
however it has been pointed out to us that cbd is no longer considered a controlled substance and tea containing cbd is widely available from mainstream companies such as adagio and harney & sons 
we would like to solicit feedback from the  r tea community regarding a change to our policy to allow cbd tea posts in marketing monday   all the usual posting rules would still apply   most general posts regarding cbd teas would still be prohibited based on rules #  and #  as cbd tea discussions almost invariably revolve around health benefits 
please submit your thoughts on the subject here 
hey all  i wanted to buy the new xbox series s,i have the older xbox but it stays mostly at my brothers house so i don   have access to it  since i don   game too often i figured the series s would be fine for me but wanted to know if i will be able to play the games i  already purchased in the past that came on disks  i have destiny   and a few other games and don   want to have to rebuy the digital version just so i can play old games that i already own   will i have to repurchase all these games or will they let me download them for free 
could someone do me a favor and measure the length of the threads on their lido e  i   also looking for the number of threads  a high resolution picture would be nice too   
i   trying to get an idea of how the lido e settings compare to the lido    if the dimensions are the same but e has more and tighter threads it should be possible to find an equation where you put in the lido e setting and get the somewhat equivalent lido   setting out  i know the blue lines can be located different and the all grinders aren        but from what i  read in here it doesn   seem too off  difference in settings could also be a result of different coffee water technique taste preference etc   
edit  maybe also the number of revolutions plus notches from true zero where the setting ring drops off the threads when you turn it from true zero to the end of the threads 
my friend posted about hosting a  scentsy party  but she  actually hosting for her friend who is a consultant  does that mean she  a consultant too or is she a customer  i   so confused lol
somewhere in the     i used to play a game on my ibm pc 
there was some sort of table and some tiles with colours  to play the game we would have to make the tiles fold over each other and match the colours in some way 
i think we won by having only one tile left  matching wrong colours would yield tiles that at some point wouldn   disappeared and we would lose the game 
does anyone know the name of this game  unfortunately i forgot   
thanks

good evening reddit  
got a bit of a weird one for you  my friend who is not the best with technology has somehow enabled the text to speech option on minecraft  
now here  the plot twist  in his xbox settings the narrator is not enabled i  had him try and turn the xbox on and off but it does nothing  
to make things even more confusing mr narrater only plays through his stereo headset   a headset that gives you game audio  even though he has game audio coming through the tv  
i know i should also go and poke the minecraft reddit but i figured i  ask here as it seems to be more of a drunk xbox situation  any other game is fine and there is no text to speech or whatever it  called 
usual troubleshooting methods have been done  turning it off and on ect  
any help would be appreciated

a friend of mine is off to mauritius after finally getting her covid vaccine  because she didn   want it because she  still breastfeeding   her son is   m old

my ps  won   connect to the internet anymore  it gives me this error code and says  cannot find the wi fi network  the wi fi network signal might be too weak or the ssid might not be correct  nw

has anyone encountered this before 
hi all i recently bought a ps  and had a question about multiplayer  i bought gta v the other day with the intention of playing some gta online but i realized in my new apartment i don   have the greatest internet connection  is there any way to test if i could even play online without paying for ps   i know theres a free trial but unfortunately i used that to test this exact problem but i didn   get a multiplayer capable game before my trial ran out 
i just need to say that people need to try a mixture of rootbeer lemonade and sprite  it is really good  trust me

hey there,
i  broke a metacarpal on my left hand so i can   use it at the moment and likely can not for weeks  i   left handed   which games could you guys recommend to play one handed 
thanks for helping me in my dire situation   
i drink     liters of water each and every day  i hate it when i don   have filled water bottles around me  yes i have to pee alot but it is totally worth it 
sometimes i am not even thirsty but i chug a whole bottle of water down just for pleasure  i may be an addict idk 
yes water taste different from house to house 
hey all,
as a diabetic i have always loved this soda  it is my go to for sure  over the last   months i cannot find it anywhere  i have checked my local grocery stores walmart target and amazon and it seems to have disappeared  i have checked and it still shows up on their website at  https   www rootbeer com products aw diet cream soda 
​
anyone got any ideas on this 
thanks 
i finally retired my old   oz bottle after a few years  had some cracks that made it leak  and i can   find the same brand anymore so i   looking for a replacement 
i had just ordered a new one off amazon  link here  and it worked well for a week but then it suddenly just does not suck anymore  same story as the   star reviews   i  tried everything but any water you can eventually get out of it comes with a heap of air  it also leaks when tipped over now too so i   guessing the tolerance with the plastic seal got messed up 
i figured there  be no better place to ask for suggestions than here 🙏
i   not too picky about dimensions or anything really my only requirement is that it has a straw and is   liters   oz  or even a little higher is fine 
anyone here has one that has worked really well for them 
thank you  🙏

hey everyone,
so my mom is in her     a widow and has been doing r&f since       she is supposed to be a level   i think but i avoid talking to her about since she ask to send invites to my friends years ago  i did live with her for a while before i landed a career position and saw that there wasn   any major change in her income  she refuses to think about getting another job and won   consider going to community college to get trained in anything  at this point me and my brother have finally gotten careers started and need to pay off school debt while building our futures  but the problem is our mom has   yrs of savings and that  it she refuses to disclose a breakdown or what she is investing in to grow that  we are willing to have her live with one of us since she supported us and we love her but i want to avoid a situation of her being completely out of savings and hoping the mlm provides  
does anyone have advice or a method for getting someone out of these 
i have recently purchased ‘gta v premium online edition '   digitally not on disk  for my ps   when attempting to download the game i am told that the data is corrupted  i have restored licences and have rebuilt database and have even tried deleting the download an trying again  i have no restrictions on my account and it is a master account

there are numerous xbox     backwards compatible games and many of them have dlcs but these games and dlcs never come on a discount sale  every week there are tons of xbox one xbox series games and dlcs on discount sales while if xbox     games have   games and a dlc on discount sale we are on a lucky week  why this 
i was thinking about getting it for my macbook for when i am away from home instead of a egpu enclosure  wanted to do some pubg games  
i remember creating a thread about gta definitive editions not getting released on steam  people supported it but a bunch of people also took the  launchers doesn   matter route   now it seems like the launcher is offline due to this messed up launch and apparently their launcher doesn   support offline mode or a decent refund system  but hey launchers don   matter  meanwhile pirates can access their games while we can   enjoy decades old games we paid money for 
update  i ended up purchasing the vario  non w  refurb from baratza with the steel burrs  thanks everyone  i   so excited  i  been dreaming of this for months 
i haven   decided if i want to go the  brew  or espresso route  i own a steeper and a pour over set up currently  
i  found a discounted vario w for ~     and it seems appealing since it leaves me open to reasonably comparable quality grinds for both coffee making methods 
ps france said it was coming out today then retracted the statement  then game came out and said minecraft will get a  stealth release  today  then two minecraft devs from twitter suggested a release on the store for  later today

edit  thank you so much everyone  i   do what i can with this 
hi there 
i know this is really silly but i was wondering if it was possible to play joysound karaoke on nintendo switch but without mic   yes again i know this sounds stupid  
as a huge karaoke fan living in a small apartment i really don   wanna bother my neighbors and my voice is already pretty loud as it is hahaha 
thanks for your replies    
i don   know if i   in the minority here but i  really grown to just hate these posts 
this is literally the subreddit dedicated to the nintendo switch of course we want all of the games to come to the switch  old new  i don   care i want it on the switch  so does everyone 
no one is going to come into the  do you want x game  thread and go  no i don   want that because i want less games on the switch 
it really just feels like a little karmawhoring on these posts and honestly i would love it if they weren   a thing anymore  they clog the sub with things that are just  duh  posts 
 
again i might be in the minority and most people don   care i   accept that but i really feel like these are extremely low effort posts that do not merit a real discussion   rule   
what discussion is there to have to  does anyone want x game      yes  or  i don   care so i   not commenting  are the only responses in those threads 
hi i was wondering  would it be possible for two switch systems to work together where one acts as the docked system and the other one as the gamepad to simulate something like the wii u  
i imagine that it  technologically feasible  two switches can already play lan mode together and both systems can either be played docked or in tabletop mode each with multiple controllers and splitscreen  so two systems that work together but display different things on their screens  isn   that functionally just like the wii u  the difference of course is that each switch is its own system whereas the gamepad was just streaming information from the console which did all the work alone  but having two systems dividing that workload seems to me to be just better 
am i missing something here 
because that would make porting all wii u games to the switch possible  although some games would just require two switches but since the two screen thing was mostly used for multiplayer on the wii u a lot of people would already have two switches ready for their multiplayer sessions  
maybe something like nintendo land for the switch at least in theory is possible  😊
me and a friend started playing borderlands    i  started to really enjoy using a controller instead of keyboard  mouse  we couldn   think of any cheap   indie or new co op games we can get ahold of and play  hopefully useable by controllers 
i   curious about this i  read somewhere in this reddit that the switch is designed like the  ds to be in sleep mode 
would love to have advice when to power off
we were discussing this with my family and i honestly didn   know if turkish  or how ex yugoslavian countries call it  bosanska kava  bosnian coffee  is a thing in america   
it  basically a finely ground unfiltered coffee made in a  đezva  pot  you bring the water to a boil remove it from heat add ground coffee stir and then return the đezva to the heat for another few seconds until the coffee almost boils over the top of the đezva  remove from the heat and let it sit for a minute or two then serve 
we usually drink it unsweetened and black or with a bit of milk    
here is a pic of one of my đezva with bosnian coffee  https   imgur com a  nvkacc

i   literally sitting here with my knitting group listening to these   airborne huns trying to recruit this woman  they ' re talking about how the founder came to the us and made millions and they could too and i want to vomit 
i don   think i   brave enough to say something to them  i  have to get up and walk over there and confront them in person and i don   think my introvert heart could take it  
i feel so bad though  
and they have these giant water bottles with the ab logo on them and just     ugh 
edit  yes i know i   a coward for not saying something  i partly am a horribly horribly introverted person when face to face with people and i also didn   want my knitting group to get in trouble if i confronted someone 
i hope that the girl they were double teaming is smart enough to not fall for it 
i feel extremely guilty that i didn   say anything but i just absolutely couldn   overcome my fear of public confrontation to do it 
so ya   can stop telling me i   a coward and created a victim i   well aware 
so it  more like dark souls i was kind of interested since it was open world but if it has dark souls like combat i   no longer interested at all i don   want to be rolling in dodging attacks just to find an opening to hit once for a       hour open world rpg

good morning lovely redditors,
excuse me if this is not a good place to post this question but i couldn   find a better suited subreddit    i figure at least some of you have experience with the quite popular délonghi coffee making machines   i have the ecam        version  thing is it keeps saying the waste tray  with coffee grounds  is full very frequently even if there is only like four or so coffees worth of grounds in there  then i discard and it  fine again so it  not broken but it  just overly sensitive  have any of you had similar experience  is there a way to maybe clean some sensor or something to make it actually only indicate that it  full when it    well   full  
in any case thanks a lot for your help 
myself and two mates just did  all in ireland   hr sea of thieves game ruined 
i just saw on the ps  accessories page that there  a official mouse and a keyboard for ps  price     coming out november     does that mean ps  is starting to support mouse and keyboard  
i   especially interested in the tea that comes inside a dried orange rind  i  forgotten what it  called 
it was back in      i think  i  been watching a friend post all these amazing things… staying home more with her kids going on cruises making so much money  i was in awe  another good friend was in her down line and was also talking about the amazing benefits  
after months of watching them  win  i decided to sign on as well  i remember thinking that i wished i had tried some of the products before signing on because then i could give my own recommendation  
i ordered enough product from the store to make my monthly quota and then started ordering stuff from ebay that people were getting rid of  i actually liked some of the product but most of it was pretty meh  i tried soooo hard to like the  greens  but it was so nasty  
i started to realize that something was up when my direct up line told me i wasn    allowed  to give away product  i was trying to run some sort of bogo deal on a post   that weirded me out  like isn   this my business 
i ended up leaving after just a couple months because i wasn   getting orders and we just couldn   maintain the monthly quota ourselves  so thankful we didn   go longer  
it wasn   too much longer after that two of my direct up lines also left  so there  my story  hope you enjoyed

i saw a while back after some guy leaked that la noire was coming to switch he said there had been talks at rockstar about more games coming clearly hinting at gta  was this ever confirmed or denied 
has there ever been a study or investigation into figuring out who the people at the tops of the various pyramids are   
in           my ex was involved with modere  rebrand of neways  for a couple years and managed to lose thousands of dollars while spending a ton of time on  her business    with respect to modere there were a handful of people that were at the top levels who had previously jumped around from other mlms that were all talked up as being superstars at their  conferences    recently i googled     of them that i could remember and they have all since moved on and are doing the same thing for other mlms again   i   guessing there are many more of these types of people who get in at the top hang around until the market is saturated and or the business dries up and then repeat that again and again   
i   not looking to get names to shame these people  even though they pretty much deserve it  but i   wondering if there is any evidence of a select group of people hopping around at the tops of new mlms and whether there  any pattern to it all   
i drink soda sometimes but i drink more water than soda  am i still not a hydro homie 
i   new to r tea   my son bought me the in cup teavana infuser for xmas last year and i  been trying new loose leaf teas ever since   apparently i  been doing it wrong by sticking my infuser in the cup of water  but anyway i   learning a lot here 
i like black teas and tend to like sweet teas   i received an ounce of spicy cinnamon orange tea from the porto rico importing co  in my redditgifts halloween exchange and i think i   in love   i don   care for berry teas or flowery teas though   
does anyone have thoughts on the one cup infuser teapot thing for me or should i just keep using my in cup infuser   i like a big cup at least    oz   
i  been heating my water in the cup to near boiling in the microwave but apparently that  wrong   my stove takes so long to heat up that i   afraid if i started to do it that way my electric bill would get higher   
any suggestions overall   any nice to be here by the way    
i bought darkest dungeon and slay the spire on this sale but sometimes when i   back home at night i   too mentally exhausted to play anything like that  i just have a gaming itch so i usually just go turn my brain off and blast some zombies in cod or something similar for an hour to scratch my itch and i can go to bed satisfied 
are there any combat heavy games that can fulfill that satisfaction in switch  i was thinking something like risk of rain   would be perfect but i heard that performance is bad in late game i   also considering hades 
what else is there  forgot to mention i prefer handheld  thanks a lot 
edit  thanks for the recommendations  so many people said diablo but i couldn   decide between it and hades so i refunded an older game and got them both lol thanks guys
as of last night my xbox     original build has been running extremely slowly  it takes two minutes to sign in and load the dashboard 
but this is not the real problem at hand  i have now become absolutely unable to sign into live  just checked the network stats in the settings  i  got    mbps downspeed  that should be plenty no 
one thing i enjoy about the current era of pc games are all the spiritual successors to defunct franchises  planet coaster city skylines bloodstained war for the overworld dungeons series etc   
but i haven   seen anything like that for command & conquer  is there a game i  overlooked or one in the works 
monthly discussion thread  previous what have you been playing threads  

use this thread to discuss whatever you  been playing lately  old or new aaa or indie    don   just list the names of games as your entire post make sure to elaborate with your thoughts on the games 

make sure to use spoiler tags if you ' re posting anything about a game  plot that might significantly hurt the experience of others that haven   played the game yet  no matter how old or new the game is  

can i change payment method to paypal and how 
just gives me an error everytime i try to matchmake with someone 
 error code       mw   or similar numbers  failed to find a session 
are the servers already broken 
what if it was a racing beat ' em up hybrid  insert storyline and you ' re racing these bad dudes to a spot  depending on where you finish the fight itself will change  you arrive and seamlessly hop out of your car and take on these baddies and whoever else was there  then you have to go someplace else so you hop in your car again  maybe some league grand prix will pop up and you have to finish a certain place or the story changes   needs some more twists to break up the monotony but could be fun and different  different being the key quality   also of course there  be other game modes for just grand prix time trial etc 
so here  the thing a few months ago one day i started playing games like apex warframe and a few others but something was off apex was constantly stuttering every few seconds warframe had frame skips and horrible screen tearing my freesync basically refused to work in any game and a bunch of other minor performance hiccups and other similar issues in most games 
now i realized i haven   installed or done anything however windows did update the day before  checked recent updates and i saw   updates installed the day before kb        and kb        
so i decided to uninstall those updates just to make sure they weren   the issue  and behold after uninstalling them everything went back to normal  
now at the time i didn   give it much thought i just figured it  something to do with my hardware and some of my settings not playing nice with that update  i paused my windows update however after a month they installed back again when i forgot to extend the update pause  i didn   realize it at the time but the second day i just noticed weird things happening in games again and i looked at the recent updates history and there they were back again uninstalled them and moved on things working again 
​
now recently some of you might have heard about a game called new world and how it  having poor performance on high end gpus like the rtx      like very poor performance  
now it just so happens that i have a friend with a rtx      that plays new world so i asked him  hey can you play the game maxed out at over    fps because my      xt can  and he was like  nope i   playing on low and dipping to    fps at times   
so i asked him to check if he has those   updates installed on his windows he told me yes he does have them  so i asked him if he could uninstall them and try playing new world without them  and guess what  maxed out     p smooth     fps  i was beyond baffled the difference could be that big 
this pretty much made me realize those   updates are probably causing all the issues you might have recently have had in certain games in which your pc really shouldn   have struggled 
so please if anyone noticed their gaming performance acting weird in the past few months check if you have kb        and kb        installed and if so uninstall them i firmly believe you will see an improvement fix for stutters fix for bad performance  in certain games  fix for screen tearing and who knows what other weird things 
in case you don   know how to see the kb numbers or to uninstall updates go to windows update settings > view update history > uninstall updates  you will see all the kb numbers there and you can selectively uninstall just those   
hope this helps you as much as it helped me and my friend 
hey y ' all i was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for a site reviewer that compares switch and pc versions of games   typically i prefer getting games on switch but if graphics are affected or the switch port isn   done well  ex  i heard my time at portia is pretty buggy on switch specifically  or features are missing on switch i  like to know before i buy   just curious if there  an easy resource out there that anyone knows about rather than googling each game individually   thanks 
i  found that when i bought some black tea leaves in bulk before i didn   have time to drink all of it before it  aromatic appeal dissipated  but when i made the tea  loose leaf like always and made very strong like always  i found it was less stimulating and much more relaxing and enjoyable compared to fresher tea  i usually drink green tea for this reason but i don   have any on hand atm and considering the pandemic i only go to the store about once every two weeks so i don   have any but i do have a lot of old  about a year  black tea in a ziplock bag still in their packaging  i checked for mold so no worries there but i   just wondering if when tea ages it increases it  l theanine content or decreases it  caffeine content or if theres something else going on leading to it being more relaxing  thanks for any replies 
so as a neophyte tea drinker i  noticed while perusing many different popular tea websites and posts here on reddit that optimal steeping temp seems to be quite important  is this true  how do you get used to telling the difference between     degrees and     degrees  should i keep a thermometer next to my teapot

this year i purchased sinking city on steam played it and finished it  more recently i visited my origin account and i noticed sinking city was there too and according to my order history i purchased it in previous year  i guess in both cases i bought it during promotions with intention to play it later and then i forgot about having it on one platform  in such case is there a point in contacting origin customer service as i haven   run sc there or is it too late after so many months

so i just found out that i have low iron and tea is a possible culprit  one reason why that might be is that some teas contain a lot of tannin which inhibits my iron intake  does anyone have any teas or brands they know that are low in tannins so i can still drink some

other info  exterior glaze is soda ash  interior is rough like you  expect unglazed to be but has no odors  i don   know what kind of clay it  made of unfortunately  made in jingdezhen 
is there a way to keep my collectible sodas without draining them or will i have to do it eventually 
i took today and tomorrow  off to try it out and havent been able to start it   i got up at     am est in hopes of playing it all day  im really let down by this gg studios
hey everyone,
i recently got into coffee and after recommendations from some friends i bought a lido e t and chemex  the coffee tastes great and the process itself is enjoyable 
not too long after i joined this subreddit and decided to also buy an aeropress  being new to coffee it  hard to know where to begin but i  read that a finer grind works best for the aeropress  
so what grind setting on the lido e t would you recommend  also what brewing guides for the aeropress would you recommend to test out first 
thank you in advance for your help  
i have a question for the subreddit  my understanding is that primerica is a company that sales insurance services not the best services but they do  
so then there are mlms  these weird from out of nowhere companies that pretend to have some sort of connection with primerica 
some of the people at the top have legit insurance sale licenses from the state and sell those services to the victims  once the victim did it  purchase the victim is encouraged to set aside the pursue of selling insurance but instead recruit more people and let them sell and take a piece from their sells and the pyramid starts to build 
is this correct  
did i get it wrong  
is primerica the source of the pyramid

my nana  grandmother  wants a water bottle for xmas and she has very specific parameters i   hoping one of you amazing humans can help me out  she is looking for something      oz with a side handle a flip spout & straw preferably double walled for extra cold deliciousness    any ideas   
i know this is probably a bit of a stretch but does anything like this exist  i love the taste of tea but i have to stick to herbals because my body can   tolerate any amount of caffeine 
i  appreciate any delicious caffeine free beverages to try in the mean time while i search 
so my ps  has been having issues for a couple days and it started when i got ps plus for a one month subscription  when i talk to my parents about the problem they say it  because of the ps plus  i say that just doesn   make sense i just don   see how that could be the problem  what are the chances ps plus could be the root of my problems  i have had the ps  pro for three years that could also be a factor 
just curious what people  thoughts are and any brewing suggestions 
for fun i aeropress  it  surprisingly rich bold and bitter lots of brown sugar  
will take it into the shop and brew it on our marzocco and see how it holds up   wendelboe suggests    in    out in    seconds 
everyone seems to think they are for sure porting smash splatoon and mk   i  even seen some people say they want to see xenonblade and another twilight princess  maybe it  because i own all these already but i am incredibly turned off by this  i want new games  not ports and remakes  
psa  you can play downwell in tate  sideways  mode with joycons attached with two hands on one joycon  no flip grip needed  it is surprisingly comfortable to play this way 
normally you can   buy   month sub  on the playstation network but there is a way to do this without a creditcard  it involves fifa    
after you lost your psn sub  boot up fifa   select profclub and enter the gamemode  you will get forced to buy a new sub  but these are marked with fifa logo  in the store  you can buy this monthly sub  from your wallet  ideal  instead of monthly with creditcard  
a friend keeps posting her modere vitamins collagens she uses daily on instagram  the products look so ridiculous and are supposed to do such unrealistic things but she  obsessed with them and makes it a daily thing  anyone know if this is a known mlm 
    and it was good   i had one before and i strongly disliked it i couldn   even finish it   but this one is very nice 
not as good as mandarin though which is what i thought it was

hey everyone i   fairly new to pour over coffee but have been investing in quality things to get myself rolling here i just have a mediocre electric grinder right now and am looking to invest in a good hand grinder  it will be primarily for v   pour overs for the foreseeable future   i may eventually try to get into espresso but we will see 
i  read conflicting things about the m   for pour over with a lot of people saying it produces a lot of fines even if using the pour over burr  people seem to like the c   but i  read the mk    had issues and have seen many threads of people looking to upgrade from the mk   with that said however it seems to be the grinder people recommend  couldn   find a ton on the     but have read that it  build quality makes it inferior to the m   
would love some opinions from anyone who  used any of these  thanks 
i just got some red rooibos tea and it doesn   look like tea at all  it  spice and pepper y and really not that nice at all  am i making it wrong  is it supposed to be like this  
so i took my cat to the vet for a checkup last weekend and i just got a call about her blood work and urinalysis  the doctor said her urine is unusually dilute which would be cause for concern if her kidney function looked abnormal but her blood work showed perfect kidneys  the vet asked  does she drink a lot of water   and i said  yes she has a drinking fountain and she loves it   the vet  conclusion   i guess she  just very well hydrated then   my partner and i could not be more proud  d
here she is waiting for her checkup in the exam room for your viewing pleasure

i enjoy the battlefield games a lot   they ' re my preferred shooter by far   my problem is i tend to suck always dying constantly   i know my biggest problem is positioning and general awareness but i   not quite sure how to improve that   i want to try to get better for battlefield      
hey everyone i   thinking about placing an order from o cha and eco cha  i usually order from yunnan sourcing and yunomius  i   wondering if anyone can tell me how the freshness and quality of tea from o cha and eco cha is compared to ys and yunomius  
typically this flavor of soda is sold with different colors but same flavor  i have tried pakola inca kola irn bru etc and they all taste same  i   wondering why so many countries make the same flavor 
i was wondering what to expect in pc  fps  gaming  what are the people like  i  been a console gamer all my life and i want to know what its like and is it true that pc gaming takes more skill because its more fast paced 
just came off a   hour run of attempting to solo g rank monsters in mhgenu and really had a huge urge to play something that helps me unwind quite specifically something like the sims or planet coaster something of which i         sure doesn   exist on the switch   
are there any hidden gems out there that have the same style i   looking for  i know cities skylines just released which would be the obvious choice but    i play that game on pc and seeing the huge downgrades in both graphical detail and general game mechanics i   not sure i  have a good time with that one is there any more floating about 
edit  thanks for all your recommendations guys  seems there  quite a few of this type of game out there so definitely going to try a few of them 
hi all  i recently discovered that someone in the company i work for reps the cabi clothing line  
she invited me to preview this season  latest and greatest  i bought a few pieces sight unseen just to be polite  this line is more pricey than you would guess 
bottom line i love these clothes  tops and bottoms always fit perfectly  the clothing is well made with higher end finishes and the accessories are costume jewelry price point but don   look tacky  
i   having a few moral dilemmas   cabi is definitely a predatory mlm
the woman i order from is extremely well off so she surely doesn   need to hustle this line as hard and relentlessly as she does 
my dilemma is that  i am vain and love the way these clothes flatter my figure  i dunno do i continue to ‘hold me nose '  and order clothing that makes me look like a million bucks even though the brand is predatory but the rep is smart enough and wealthy enough to not face financial ruin if she doesn   have a great sales month

i just got this idea of upgrading a regular drip coffee machine with a custom shower head and was wondering if anyone also had thought about this as i couldn   find any posts anywhere   maybe it  just a stupid idea    
one could try and mount something like the shower head of a watering can to the single hole water outlet and make some modifications to the filter basket so that it still fits in the machine 
i hope i am inspiring some genious engineer with this post to come up with a super cool invention now   
been doing pour over since the start of the pandemic and at first i thought i only liked a limited set of beans   i  been trying this subscription service that sends me different bags and there are some that don   taste right to me 
today i was brewing one that i thought tasted too bitter but i was in a rush   i rushed my pours and the coffee ended up matching the tasting notes and it  very good now   now i know i have to pour faster for this coffee 
is there an easy way to know how to prepare a new coffee  perfectly  without having to experiment through half a bag 
i   pretty low income so the cheaper the better  i   definitely willing to make an investment if i need to  i just want a water bottle that holds enough water for me to last a while   maybe at the minimum a half gallon  
thanks y ' all 
i   not a very  die hard  switch player i usually only end up playing on sunday nights for some reason  a few months ago bestbuy had a big sale on switch games and rabbids was one of the ones on sale for      i decided to give it a whirl and i actually enjoyed it immensely  i thought they did a great job at capturing the spirit of mario while making a surprisingly deep turn based type combat  
the only real issue i had with the game is that it was too long  there are   worlds with     levels per world and by the time i started world   i was ready to be done with the game 
this morning i had a chance to compare some starbucks ethiopian medium roast to boji kelloo kochere ethiopian from yardstick coffee in makati  what a contrast  the starbucks was quite dark roasted  there were some floral undertones  underneath the burnt flavor   too bad starbucks could not ease up on the roasting  the yardstick also a medium roast was ten times lighter than the starbucks  i might prefer the starbucks if it was not so over roasted  maybe i should mix the two 
my xbox has crashes and freezes with frame drops it only happens like once a day if i return it for repair will microsoft just send it back if they can   find the issue

i think beachbody is a really great idea and if they offered these at home workouts and workout retreats they could be successful  i  seen some people lose a lot of weight with those workouts  if they didn   have the mlm boss babe narrative i think they could be a great company
i   seeing more and more people getting a series x and saying they got it in store which gives me hope that i   get one but i got some questions  do people go to best buy and walmart every day in store to check for a console  or do you call ahead every day or something 
i want to try my luck at finding a console but i   very shy and i don   want to be annoying by going into a bestbuy or gamestop every day just to check for a console then leave  i also feel like if i did it every week the employees would also get annoyed that i   in there every week and even if i didn   go in store and i just called they would be able to tell it  me every time  
so for the people who got a series x in store did you just randomly happen to see one when you went in for something else or did you go in every day or week to check for it or did you call the store every week to check if it  in stock 
i know it  been discussed ad nauseam but seeing angel  punishment sitting at the number   spot of best sellers  number   spot for download only games  at     simply because they put it on sale for     off last week so people would pick it up for    cents  free with a tiny bit of gold points … how does anybody at nintendo look at this and think  this is fine  it  an absolute joke

so far i saw dilmah tea ahmad tea mumtaz teakruthi  what  your suggestions 
edit   i   in portugal 
update  last night i set everything up by my bed and then the dog woke up at      and insisted we go out for walk immediately  so much for tea in bed  but it was cheering to know it was there waiting for me  plus this whole thread is making my day  
hi everyone  i   trying to figure out ways to make mornings a bit cheerier and i   thinking a cup of hot tea without having to get up might do the trick  anyone have tried and true ways to accomplish this 
this is just a post i wanted to make praising the effort steam has put into linux gaming  i  been playing around with vulkan and compatibility tools and i have yet to have any issues  i  tested skyrim watch dogs   witcher   and ds  with no problems other than a minor audio bug in skyrim which only occurred because a setting wasn   enabled  today i tried connecting my switch controller through bluetooth  wired worked out of the box  and my pc immediately detected and connected to the controller which then worked out of the box  i might be in the minority here but i absolutely hate connecting controllers on windows it feels like i can never get them connected without spending      minutes on it 
​
i used to dual boot windows and linux but i feel comfortable enough gaming on linux now that if i ever need to spend money to keep using windows i   moving entirely to linux  so kudos to steam for making gaming on linux a viable alternative 
​
those of you with linux systems how has it been for you

i   looking to purchase a monitor for my new series s  i currently own an acer     p monitor with   hz  i want to upgrade to a monitor with better color accuracy and     p  the only thing is the options in my budget are only   hz  is it worth it to save up for a    hz one or should a   hz display work 
this may not be a direct link to tea but i am seriously curious  how do they do it so fast and so well 
my current controller died and i   trying to get a replacement quick dualshock  s are close to     so i turned to  rd party ones what controllers are good 
i am on tight budget say      max for console and stuff  this would be my first console although i am like     i am super confused will admit i dont know much about these stuff  
my dilemma is this  
xbox series s or ps  or wait  and pray  for ps  digital  can any expert help me through this like am   yr old  and due to chip shortage everything is unavailable so how and where are people buying consoles from  
long story short i saw eso in my library downloaded it and it let me play it  i don   think there is a free trial going around  i   sure i didn   buy the game 
i was  really  bored tonight and came upon the wiki for mtn dew and noticed that on the page for supernova it says it  been confirmed for a      comeback  does anybody have any information on this  it  my all time favorite soda and i would stab my brother for another can of it 
a few times a year we treat ourselves to a pound of blue horse peaberry      kona  about     shipped   i cannot recommend it highly enough and i have to say it  the best coffee i  ever had  does anyone have any other recommendations for kona  what kinds of coffee have you had that are better  we want to branch out into trying other higher end coffees for special occasions 
any time i google it it just shows me news articles from months ago 
does anyone know if there are any d&d style co op or multiplayer games for ps  
ideally i  love to find a board game turn based style d&d game like pathfinder but it doesn   have to be either just so long as it follows d&d like rules and more then   player can play   
i know a really great d&d multiplayer turn based board game just came out for oculus quest   but i prefer my ps  so my kids can play with me 
i do have a scale i just don   use it super often  i have a scoop i  been using for years and do pour over directly into a mug  the scoop size apparently holds     grams of ground coffee  all the mugs are different sizes but some of them are around       ounces  i usually do   flat scoops per mug and use an old starbucks dripper essentially a melitta style  
every time i  messed around with      ratios it just seems absurdly strong to me like i can   drink it at all  is this common 
hey  r coffee 
i just got my aeropress in the mail yesterday  i bought it to more or less augment my current coffee armoury  i usually use a french press but lately i  been having issues with the extra fine sediment in it  it leaves me feeling overly jittery 
anyway i made my first cup of aeropress this morning and not knowing what i was doing followed the included instructions to the t  what i noticed immediately was that i didn   really make a full cup    normally i enjoy a ~   oz cup with a little half and half and some sugar  that  pretty much the goal    ounces 
well making a cup with the aeropress the instructions told me to fill it up to the   so i did  the result was not even close to being a full cup of coffee so in a panick i used some more boiling water to dilute it some and bring it up to my desired amount  the end result was not bad at all very good flavor but i just feel like i did it completely wrong and there are better ways 
how does  r coffee go about aeropressing out a    oz cup of joe 
i love drinking coffee but i recently quit   began to switch to caffeine supplements to get a more consistent amount because it would make me feel very jittery or nothing at all every time i had a cup of coffee  i think     mg is the prime point for me but i   just curious if there is a way to really keep coffee consistent to get the same effect for the most part 
i absolutely love tea  but i don   really have the disposable income to feed my addiction with strictly loose leaf tea so lately i  found myself turning to bagged teas more and more  there  an abundance of blogs and websites that review loose high quality teas but it seems a bit more difficult to find a comprehensive source of reliable bagged tea reviews outside of steepster  do you think people might be interested in a bagged tea focused blog where i maybe reviewed a few brews a week  could be supermarket stuff obscure online tea brands healthfood store tea ust thought it might be a fun  and useful   p  side project    
so me and my boys have a habit of going around and trying some nice sodas  if you guys have any sodas that you really like i  love to try it and post a review on here   any suggestions would be appreciated 
i know the vast majority of you probably take your coffee black and i used to exclusively do the same but i wanted to pick everybody  brain on something  i typically add a pinch of salt to the grounds for brewing and a very very small amount of sugar to my coffee in the mug wanted to share why and get some thoughts 
first the salt  got this idea from an old alton brown french press video  here  an example of how much salt i add to my brews this is a   g batch of grounds in my bonavita metropolitan  i do a similar ratio to french press and don   have a pour over at home yet but not sure if i would add it to a v   or not  here  an article on the matter  not crazy about the article but at least it has sources  long story short we all know that salt enhances flavor but in small concentrations it specifically increases sweet and sour flavors and reduces our perception of bitter ones 
finally the sugar  i don   remember where i first got this idea but i read that a small amount of sugar can have similar effects  this article discusses the matter at length but the major takeaway for me comes from the section under  sweetness flavor enhancement and flavor balance 

in food products sugar plays an important and unique role in contributing to the flavor profile by interacting with other ingredients to enhance or lessen certain flavors  the addition of sugar enhances flavors by increasing the aroma of the flavor  a flavor aroma possesses no taste properties but once combined with sugar the sweetness of sugar and the flavor aroma work synergistically  spillane        for example if a peach aroma is added to a solution with no sugar the solution would have no taste but with sugar added in the solution sweetness and the peach flavor can be perceived 

another much shorter and maybe less scientific article suggests that concentrations less than    will have this effect without adding noticeable sweetness of its own  i tested the amount of sugar i typically add to my   oz thermos and it approached this threshold but didn   quite reach it although i typically eyeball the sugar addition 
i welcome and thoughts or comments on this and encourage you to try it on your own  admittedly my process is very anecdotal and unscientific but i like what i  noticed in my cups from my repeated tests  if you do try this please let me know what you think 
tl dr   i add very small  <   by weight  amounts of sugar and salt to my coffee  i like it and think you should try it here  some reasons why 
edit  did a blind test and messed up my salt calculation badly so the altered samples tasted very bad but the two with sugar salt had noticeably stronger aromas so much so that i was able to correctly identify them before tasting them  will repeat the test with better amounts tomorrow 
so my mother is a medical doctor who retired about   years ago from practice  in place of work she has many hobbies — carriage driving and gardening being the ones she finds most productive — and serves in various community rôles and positions in the small town we live in  due to a combination of    years work as a medical doctor and the family ability to save money like mad she is not desperate for money  she has seen amway bankrupt a relative and is thus aware of mlms and the damage they can do  nonetheless she has spoken positively of rodan and fields products — which she has heard and told me as such were created by a pair of dermatologists responsible for proactiv a  non mlm  acne treatment that does apparently work  she routinely buys them from a friend of hers — who claims in turn that a lot of people join for product discounts — and also claims that r f is not like other mlms  she has made clear to me that she has no intention of joining r f as a consultant let alone selling r f or recruiting a downline  it seems she just likes r f 
should i be concerned  on the one hand the possibility of my mom becoming a hun is essentially negligible  on the other hand i don   know what to say as to whether mom is unknowingly supporting a sinister mlm via her purchases  is r f less of an mlm  or is my mom  friend lying 
my ps  brings that up every   mins or so and i lose my internet connection  i can   find anything online 
hi  so some of you have seen my comments   i   in the process of leaving it  works  
why  largely the mom wine culture cr p  i   not yet    i don   have the energy to deal with all the messsenger posts 
also when uplines stalk  and their words not mine  your social profiles it  just darn creepy  
why haven   i left yet  
i have a respectable downline  in hun terms  of     if you look at my downline my sidelines etc i  got the chance to potentially help         leave  
if you have any suggestions i  love to know  and i   happy to share scripts what we are told to post counterpoints to upline instructions so you can help people close to you to leave 
taking a cold long sip of ice water is better than taking a long drag of a cigarette any day and if i am wrong i don   want to be right 
i  seen videos on how to fix this but seeing as his warranty is still valid it makes more sense to try and get a free replacement before i terminate the warranty with a screwdriver 
i   making this post because i  never done this so idk where to start  how do i arrange a replacement  should i phone email microsoft what proof of warranty do i need etc etc
the  rd game of the series golden sun dark dawn released in      which is a pretty long time if a series is dark for ten years i typically think it  at least going into hibernation but dark dawn was on the ds meaning in terms of system cycles golden sun only skipped one generation that being the  ds 
also from what i know camelot  last game on the switch was mario tennis  aces       and if you know aces you know that content isn   exactly it  strength meaning if they were making another game it  probably be similar in content size  so if camelot was making something like a mario golf why would it be taking this long to know anything about it  i know nintendo has started to adopt this new rapid announcement followed by a close release but it  still a bit odd  
what do you think though  do you think we   see a new game  maybe a remastered trilogy or a remaster of the first game  genuinely curious 
   and the water never tasted the same  i feel like one of my favourite things was taken away from me  i don   want to drink water at home anymore because i know it will not taste as nice and will leave a bad aftertaste  thank you for listening to my first world problem from one hydrohomie to another 
when mlmers approach me i deal with them by asking for them directly   how much have you made  it works very well and the     that don   make any money always try to change the subject like the individual below

i  tried some oolong gaiwan style and would like to learn more  
any suggestions how to approach it  
my idea is to work my way through different tgy s  
i  tried a decent oolong variety but not paid attention  currently a pressed taiwanese which i like a lot     i just feel tgy could be a good starting point  
for context    i have a coffee background  tea up until now was the random british bag i never really liked  green teas was an improvement but oolong is something i feel i can stick with

what are some regional sodas that you guys know  i   from the states and i started collecting caps recently 
     and nintendo still hasn   found a way to make the most basic of friend interactions available in their games or on their system  if you  be able to message them on the switch itself and ask for their makerid that would be one thing but you can   even do that  discuss 
there currently is a thread in the gamestop subreddit but it looks like gamestop corporate has made a mistake and the sku provided for the legend of zelda  breath of the wild master edition in store was a fake and not meant to be reserved in store  you may or may not get calls from your local store that this is occurring  
if that is the case just to make sure if it becomes available at any other retail store or online please pre order it before  cancelling refunding  your pre order at your local gamestop store if you did that today  again confirm this with your local gamestop before doing anything hasty 
i know i may get downvoted for sharing this bad news but please don   shoot the messenger  just sharing the info in hopes that you may be able to secure the master edition elsewhere just in case  good luck

i   looking for a new water bottle for back to school and there are just so many options and i don   know what would be a good choice  any recommendations 
if you only had the ability to drink one soda for the rest of your life which would you pick and why 
i drink one cup of black coffee a day for energy
other than that since i was a kid i drink pretty much water  soda and juice disgust me tbh
i      and i  never had alcohol
i   quite a private person and don   enjoy people knowing what i   doing all the time so i always appear offline and will make game settings private
so i   not sure how he is able to know what game i   playing as everything is set to private on discord and steam  i   not sure whether there is a glitch or any other app u may suggest for him to know these things  
thank you for reading

then comes the description of the trailer 
i currently am using a         hz monitor and i have dropped out of comp cs go and comp tf  so i don   really need    hz anymore  i want to sell my monitor and either get an ultrawide or  k or possibly just an ultrahd      p  monitor  
right now i am using a single     but i can upgrade to sli a month or so after i get the monitor and save up some more     
i   most interested in ultrawide or  k i am seeing great things about both and it  super hard to pick  hoping some people have opinions who have tried owned own both instead of someone who has only tried one or the other but i   still listen to ya   
i personally never brew tea at boiling point unless i   drinking an herbal tea  i also brew my teas both western and gongfu style depending on my mood   i just don   like the astringency bitterness and darker flavors that come out of the tea as a result of brewing at the       °c range  based on my personal experience even the heavily oxidized teas such as da hong pao and lapsang souchong taste like they should when brewed at      °c  however what i do notice is that the nutty woody and dark flavors take a backseat to the lighter mellow brighter and floral flavors when brewed at      °c  when brewed at the       °c range the tea becomes stronger and sometimes the flavor even leaves a really strong kick in the mouth 
as for steeping time i usually stick to   mins for all oolongs and   mins for all black teas when brewing western style   for gongfu style i usually start with    secs and increase each interval by   secs  these time intervals seem to work perfectly for me 
so i have the xbox series s and i switched over to it on christmas day but when i checked my owned games some were missing and i can   re install them and i got some off the xbox store but their not showing up 
i personally like my water some fruit in it like lemon 
longtime lurker and a mobile user yadda yadda yadda

i bought final fantasy x x  remastered after playing ff   people said hey man you need to experience ff in its glory days and play the old ones well i looked and it was on sale for    dollars gamestop pro day sale and my local stores does military discounts  d   so i picked it up and i saw its runs native  k on xbox one x and i heard by most that this is a good entry for those new subject to opnion  i am beyond thrill to play a new game and i need a good story fix  anyway    what final fantasy should i play next after im done with this saga 
finding sarsaparilla in the ne is hard enough  bb&b used to carry sioux city in their  world market  section but that was split off into a whole other chain of stores who carry earp     they ' re not terrible and did the job   now with the lockdown all those stores are closed indefinitely and nowhere else sells it  i  tried looking online and soda u was really the only place i found but after shipping it was like      
i love root and birch beers and just found sarsaparilla to take the flavors to the next level  is there anywhere else online i could check out  or are the any recommendations for say a birch beer that tastes just like a sarsaparilla  tia

edit  thanks everyone i ended up with little nightmares   spiritfarer and aer  memories of old  
these will keep me busy for a while but i   be sure to bookmark this thread for the future   
i just moved to florida and i  heard about a soda shop called rocket fizz  i live about    mins away from one and was wondering what is it like and would it be worth it to go and visit it  what kinds of sodas do they sell there 
so i  been practicing my latte art but i  been struggling making art with what i think flat white milk should be  my problem is always the first pour  it always breaks  but when i stretch my milk longer  say for a latte or capp  it seems to not be a problem  i see internet videos where baristas make perfect art with flat whites even with aggressive first pours  is it a steaming problem  i can definitely make glossy velvety milk but when i pour the shapes don   hold too well  any help is appreciated 
i have this girl on facebook who keeps sending me messages about this gel  https   www getonthegel com    it  from new u life and i did some digging but not much is posted about it  does anyone have experience with people trying to sell this gel to you  i don   want to be rude to her but she  driving me crazy  how can i politely tell her i don   want to try her product while explaining it  an mlm  scam 
i   not going to buy a ps  if the download speeds are going to continue like this  i have a fiber      m bits per second connection and i   downloading games at   m bytes per second and it  just a waste l  the whole point of getting the fiber connection was to be able to download games and updates fast  and this is an issue on the ps  as well and as far as i   aware the xbox has none of these problems 
i started divinity original sin   in the spring and put in    hours before i had to stop at beginning of the summer  i just booted it up and im in the middle of the game and theres so many keybinds i dont even know where to begin  hate when this happens   
i can   believe i completely missed the spider man dlc for the avengers game anyone know any ways it  possible to get it if i  missed it or is that it completely gone 🙄
so yeah i   playing crash   and loving it  a bit challenging at times but that  a platform game for you and the original games could be tough at times as well  but i haven   seen much talk about the game,
and crash is like a big playstation thing  the game is really good and i   honestly surprised by the lack of buzz  there are no posts about it on the front page of this sub and i checked the new posts and also nothing  there isn   no sticky post about it even though it just came out  it seems to be getting very little attention even though it  literally crash bandicoot and a completely new game  are people not liking it or are people just not playing it

i bought my   year old nephew a switch for christmas i   looking for a really good protective case that  dockable  i remember the old nerf cases but it seems like they don   make them for switch  
also are the off brand pro controllers just as good as the nintendo brand ones   if so could someone recommend me one 
i dont know what to do to spread awareness  its honestly spreading like wild fire and it right next to where i work 
the root beer and ice tea and other flavours are all nice  however regular cola is not very great 
how can improve the cola 
i   new here been hydrating since my attempts to lose weight but i don   know if i   doing it right 
so my girlfriend keeps telling me to hydrate or die drate  i tell her that i hydrate but she continues to tell me to hydrate  what do i do to get her to believe me when i   hydrating 
my wife and i both have ps s  if we both buy this can we play online just us two with ai  or will we have strangers join our game 
can   find the answer but am considering buying 
it  confusing me to no end   i guess i should say that i just got the ps  and it  my first playstation  and first console in a long time  
i   hoping that if there  some kind of reason for this and i understand why that maybe remembering to reverse the two will become more natural 
i constantly have this error code whenever i try to start final fantasy x x   i don   know if it happens with other games as i  only tested a few  by googling the error code i  seen that it can happen on any game tho  i own a physical copy and have already tried both reinstalling the game and rebuilding my database  it didn   work  
i have also tried i have also tried to switch it from my external hard drive to my system database and then trying the two fixes  that also didn   work  i hope anyone knows any other possible fixes as i   getting kinda frustrated by this 
i have a bad habit of ordering tea i think sounds great from shops i   unfamiliar with and then having a bunch of duds  i don   know of anyone in my life who likes tea  aside from southern style sweet tea  and there isn   much of a local tea culture  
so i   looking for ideas on what to do with the tea i don   like  it  usually an oz or so of flavored teas that i  opened tried and then set aside  i don   want to throw it away  i   also paranoid if i give opened tea to some stranger they might get sick and come at me over it  though i would love to give it away trade locally  
thank you in advance 
people here often mention that they enjoy certain coffee varieties such as  pink bourbon or bernadina for example  or coffee from certain regions such as yirgacheffe  
not including gesha which coffee variety or region do you like the most  what makes it different and tasty  is it easy to order or is it more of a rare special coffee   some examples would be appreciated 
i notice that my pure life romance hun friend always is posting about how her bonuses are life changing  however they ' re only like      maybe      or her biggest one was        however she only gets the bonuses     times per year  do they realize that those bonuses aren   a life changing amount of money  
to preface i know a lot of people would like extra money and that  what they ' re preying on but at the same time those are not life changing amounts of cash  i can   even pay my rent for              wouldn   even make a noticeable dent in my medical debt 
for me their bragging is more sad than anything because they ' re talking about such a small amount that it  not even important or consistent  any thoughts on this   i work as a purchaser for my job so i send pos for   k  on the regular so my opinions on money are a little skewed  i   wondering other peoples opinions on this  
my ps  pro starts up saying it can   turn on plug in control   so i did    control don   link up   when i try and turn off manually beeps   times but doesn   shut down   what  going on 
the aeropress funnel fits perfectly  i looked everywhere for a good funnel and ended up cutting the bottom off of one before realizing that i had one all along 
how do you deal with the feeling of not being thirsty  do you just kind of force it down 
i  gotten into coffee the last couple of months and have explored a few different coffee techniques  i started my journey with a french press  then an aeropress  i then went on to try the bodum pour over which i just didn   like  due to my dislike for the pour over i went to the clever dripper with fond memories of my previous immersion brews  over that time i went from pre ground coffee  to fresh beans using a blade grinder  then a timemore c   which i eventually upgraded to my current  zpresso jx pro  well over the weekend i decided to give pour over another try but with a v    today i made my first cup out of the v    it is so beautiful  the subtle flavors and pleasant bitterness of the coffee that were blunted by the clever dripper and masked by the sweetness and earthiness of immersion brewing now come to the front of the cup  this is despite being my first v   brew my favorite cup of coffee to date  i   still go back to my immersion brewers  wether my aeropress or clever dripper  from time to time  but i don   see anything becoming my daily driver ahead of the v   
my personal picks are spider man shattered dimensions spider man web of shadows transformers war for cybertron and lollipop chainsaw 
she turned    this year  i   baffled this has gone on this long  one of her friends got tricked into doing it and they realized it was an mlm way back in the day  and here were are in      and it  still a thing  baffled 
rambling backstory  feel free to skip to next header 
i recently started a new job and decided it would be more cost efficient for me to make my coffee at work  because i  be paid for the time   i took my aeropress to work and in addition to not having to want to navigate cream that must be stored in the kitchen on the other side of the building really kind of noticed the quality of my coffee tanked  i started taking more care i actually bought some whole beans started checking my coffee ratios  i was using too much  and measured the temperature of the water i was using 
things greatly improved  i could significantly reduce the amount of additives i needed in my coffee to make it drinkable  after checking the top posts here apparently you guys greatly recommend getting fresh roasted coffee  this checked out because the trader joe  coffee i was using was smelling terrible  my girlfriend knew of a local roaster and we went there to try it out 
not really knowing what i wanted or what to ask for they offered me to make me a pour over  my girlfriend said she  treat me to two to try them out so we did that   when i took the first sip i was absolutely blown away  i could actually taste flavors in the coffee rather than just acid sourness and acrid horror  i immediately bought a bag that sounded good and tried it out the next day 
my coffee game was changed  now when i make coffee in the aeropress i can make it black and it is great  still kind of single note but very drinkable and enjoyable  but i wanted those flavor notes  i ended up adding a lot of different coffee things to my christmas list  a baratza grinder bonavita kettle chemex v   filters for both timer scale    i got most of them for christmas and those that i didn   get i ended up buying on my own  i also went back to the roaster shop several times to try different coffees but now the pour overs always tasted acidic and bad  i needed to add cream and sugar to make them drinkable 
actual questions here 
i  made several cups of coffee a day trying to figure out how to get those flavor notes from both my chemex and v    i  watched hoffman  videos as well as many others but i just can   get it right  i need help  
i  been using   mg of coffee to    mg of water  i find i get   oz    ml out of this ratio   i   trying a  medium  grind an    on my baratza  i  tried hoffman   dig a hole  method before blooming and blooming with a flat bed  i let it bloom for    seconds with about   ml of water sometimes swirling to moisten everything sometimes not  i have tried pouring with intend to stir the grounds with the stream and pouring more gently  pretty much every attempt i  made has been nearly undrinkable and i always just want to go back to using my aeropress 
the thing is over the holiday i made coffee for everyone with my aeropress  they loved it but they felt bad asking for it because i had to  at the time  manually grind the beans and make only one cup at a time unless i wanted to make a big huge mess  i  love to be able to make an amazing cup of coffee for everyone with my chemex  how can i possibly get to this point 
something i noticed when i run a connection test on my ps  through the settings menu is that i get speeds that are well below what my isp  verizon fios  gives me  i get   mbps down and    up whenever i test on my pc but on ps  its always a lot less like    down    up  and when i quickly test again the speed results are not consistent and fluctuate a lot going faster or slower  anyone else have this similar issue  
several of our local  nutrition  shops have changed their names overnight   either replacing nutrition with our city name or just dropping it all together   so far it appears to just be a facebook name change because they are still using the hashtags and their old logos are being used as the cover photos on the page   i  heard this is happening in other towns too so i   guessing there is more to the story 
i   a big fan of those one off or obscure sodas and i want to try and find more of them 
so… anyone know anything about where to get stewart  key lime  i  only ever had two bottles and i fell in love  been looking everywhere to try and find some but they ' re out of stock everywhere  anyone know where i could get any  do they not make it anymore 
being a brit i do enjoy tea with milk once a day  i like pg tips for normal black tea but their earl grey tea bags aren   great  i disliked twinnings standard earl grey mainly because of the smell of the bag after steeping  i see they have an alternative blend or are there any other earl grey bags worth trying 
i am open to loose leaf suggestions too something light which i wouldn   have with milk  i particularly like roobios earl grey it is very smooth and caffeine free 
i guess she doesn   like to be bothered by people trying to get her to buy stuff  the irony 
what would it be  
i   new to tea and want to know all the secrets   😉  so far all i can think about is where tea has been my whole life 
does anyone that plays world war z know if there is a solo mode that doesn   require live gold 
i  been reading benchmark all over the web how ray tracing it just a frame killer and brings no benefits  i wanted to try it for myself   after tweaking a few settings i was able to run the game  k  fps with ray tracing on medium setting resolution scale     and the rest of the settings on ultra except for fxaa   i just don   like the look of fxaa   i didn   use dlss has it made the texture a bit blurry  the image quality was far superior with ui scaling   the difference in image quality between     to      scaling is minimal  
the game just looked and play fantastic  of course if you push rtx to high on ultra this is where you get the biggest fps drop with minimal lighting improvement over medium settings  just like any games you need to tweak a few settings and you get both the benefits of frame and ray tracing   i know this subreddit loves to hate on the rtx     ti but it  pretty good card   it  a bit on the expensive side but it does have some benefits   the lighting does make a difference  
hey y ' all    i   writing a novel set in dayton ohio in      where one character eventually gets into an mlm  does anyone have a feeling for which mlms were most popular around that time  i feel like it was before peak oils and peak leggings so i don   want her to get in on the ground floor i want her to get crushed under it  maybe pure romance since that was based in cincinnati  i appreciate any ideas  
lots of terrible games are available as usual but there are some gems on there namely the steamworld series  steamworld dig   &   as well as steamworld heist are underappreciated masterpieces that are a steal for their price and now more than ever at     for the whole series  give the e shop a glance here and there for these amazing deals 
are you supposed to put sugar in espresso based drinks  like if i make a latte or a cappucino am i supposed to add sugar when the drink is done or is the milk supposed to serve as the only sweetener  or is it just up to personal preference  thanks  sorry  thank you

i   currently using a medium fine grind with a kalita wave     and some ethiopian yirgacheffe and it  quite literally clogging my filter by the time it gets down to around   minutes    g    g water   is this a result of my lido generating too many fines or is it just the beans themselves  is it worth realigning the lido e  i  probably ground     pounds through it now and i haven   once done a thorough cleaning realignment 
i know they  had some controversy over the past few years but i was wondering if there  a consensus about their dancong oolongs  they look nice but i wonder what part of that is cleaver marketing  any help is appreciated

i can   seem to get a palatable cup of coffee with my new bonavita   cup bv    gw  i   the only coffee drinker in my house so i generally only brew    ml  ~  oz  at a time  i know this is not ideal for this brewer because of the size of the basket but i see a lot of other people using this brewer successfully for small batch brewing 
temperature and water volume are the control  brew fine can only be adjusted by turning on or off the pre infusion option  i grind my beans fresh immediately before brewing  i   using     g of beans for the    ml brew  i  been playing around with grind size  using a bodum bistro burr grinder i have tried every setting from     way between espresso and drip to halfway between drip and french press which is approximately the middle     of grind settings 
i keep getting overly soapy tasting very weak or very bitter coffee 
just looking for other people  tips trick suggestions  thanks 
posting on behalf of a very close childhood friend who doesn   have reddit 
my brother  trashy toxic girlfriend just started arbonne and i saw on her instagram story a post of the checkout window with her thanking her boo  my brother  for paying for the starter pack already looping him in financially  
back to my  op   voice  i  known the kid since he was little  he was always a good kid but for the past   or so years has seemingly lost his critical thinking skills   the girlfriend is just horrible and has put them both in debt over things like luxury furniture when their budget would call for second hand ikea  they repeatedly break up and get back together and she knows how to manipulate him  he  not innocent of course but grew up a good kid with a loving open minded family and a solid group of childhood friends  who hate the girlfriend and think she  a terrible influence 
help    how do we extract him without pushing him away   or inflicting the smallest amount of damage possible  
i just upgraded to the new console and put my old one on the floor for not even    minutes and my cat decided to pee on it  what should i do    
why does the usb headphones connected to console has less audio output than the     mm jack headphones connected to controller  
i have plantronics usb headset which i use it for work on my laptop its just fine there but on directly connecting to console its output is very less  
is it becasue console itself doesn   have a inbuilt speakers unlike controller  
does this mean if i get ea play i can only play a game for   hours then i have to purchase it or am i just being an idiot 
hey guys i was just wondering what your favorite not mainstream sodas are  what i mean by that is like something that you can   get at like a fast food restaurant  or better yet something actually decently rare or imported or something  thanks
i recently built a gaming pc that was to be my steam box for all controller compatible games  wireless     controller hdmi connection to my tv wireless headphones etc  i keep a bluetooth mouse and keyboard around for when i need them 
note there are games that play better with m k  i leave those to my other machine 
i had hoped that i could get the computer to launch directly into big picture mode and have it act like a true console  i believe that this is what valve hoped for too    but it  far from the way things actually are  
windows   cannot launch into bpm  so a mouse click is required to get into a game  
some games  i e  skyrim  cannot start without a launcher  so even from bpm another mouse click 
if the game  or steam  crashes you ' re back in windows  that  not a console experience even if it is a  steam box  sold by valve 
there is also the overarching problem of windows not being completely controllable with a gamepad which i do not understand  even if i were to use  rd party software to get mouse functionality out of my controller i still need the keyboard   there do not exist any working drivers for the xbox chatpad even though it would be literally perfect for   ft text input on pc 
a perfect situation would be the     controller   chatpad to control windows but sadly this is not possible  i wonder how valve will overcome this issue with their console 
    that pepsi  been feeding us the nasty high fructose corn syrup version for the past     years  this stuff is soooo much better 
i remember loving mountain dew as a kid but one day as a teenager i noticed it was all of sudden disgusting  it tasted like it was flavored with cleaning supplies and it  been that way ever since  
just like any other corporation the obsessive drive to cut costs and profit ruined the product  it  probably  negatively affected people  health in one way or another too 
they should  just left it alone  the  real sugar  version is so much better  i hope it eventually replaces the hfcs version all together  
anyone here agree that the hfcs mountain dew has something  off  about it  its like you can just feel how bad and unhealthy it is for you right as it hits your stomach 
i recently discovered cold matcha lattes with almond milk at a local cafe    now i  like to make them at home  most of the chains and big brands seem to have added sugar but i   looking for a powder brand with no added sugar that would make a nice cold tea  thanks

it  a steam key that you will get in your amazon library after purchase 
since civ v is one of the best strategy games i  personally played in the last couple years this is a major steal 
the game includes steam trading cards and extensive workshop mod support 
this is the historical low for complete edition as far as i know  the historical low on steam was ~       and amazon has had this same deal a couple months back 
steam key is only valid for north america

i am a casual video game player and have been playing on ps  ps  for several years now  my friends and i mostly play first person shooter games online like call of duty  for years i just used the playstation mic that comes with the console  recently my playstation mic got destroyed and i had to switch to something else  i tried the apple headphones but they have to much buzz for the people your chatting with  so i bought the cheap turtle bay mono headset from target   this is when my dog started having issues  like i said i  played call of duty for years and used a mic with the controller with no issues  but now my dog gets really stressed when i play modern warfare  it doesn   happen every time but it does happen frequently  
some details 
i bought the new headset about the same time i got modern warfare  i   not sure if it is the headset doing something to set her off or something in the game  i have changed the settings to have all the audio go through the headset and she still gets upset so that makes me think it  the headset  
our bedroom upstairs is directly over our living room where i play  i usually leave the dog in the room but it even starts to upset her when she  not in the same room where i   playing  
if she is in our room she whines and she gets on our bed and paces  she drives my wife crazy  so my wife will put her out of the room  if she comes downstairs she will constantly whine at me and want outside  then she will want back in   minutes later  she  only fine once i stop playing  all of this really only happens when i use the headset but all i really do is play online with friends  
my thinking is that the headset is creating some kind of high pitched tone that she can hear and it sets her off  i don   know if that  crazy or not but that  what it feels like  
any advice for this

i recently started roasting my own beans and i   in need of some advice  i first tried with a popcorn popper but it ended up burning the motor so i tried a skillet  the roast came out ok but not very even  some beans were much darker than others during the roasting process so it was hard to gauge the roast level that the beans were at  the resulting cup has tasted slightly burnt when brewed in my chemex and doesn   have a lot of flavor to it  any advice from those who use a skillet to roast

i   really looking to get a tv that   let me get the full benefits of the series x over its lifespan really wanna take advantage of the  k and    fps the thing is i also wanna keep the size of the tv down i sit only a couple feet away and i find that the     tv i have now is the perfect size but it seems like most if not all tvs that have uhd and    hz are large like     or greater and they ' re expensive

i  recently gotten a lot more into tea than i used to and have not had a ton of experience with oolong type tea in general  
i have read that some oolong teas have a very floral taste but as i live in fujian i tend to find more of the mountain earthy type tasting oolong though it does have some floral aromas and tastes to it 
when i first tried oolong tea i must have done something horribly wrong as it was really quite bitter though have recently gotten a lot better at tea brewing in general to the point that there is only a  slightly bitter taste between the nice earthiness of it  
my question is does oolong tea generally always have a little bit of a bitter aftertaste or is there still something i could be doing wrong  
hi r tea  i am new to this subreddit and from what i  read so far many of you don   care for teavana due to the customer service  setting that aside which products do you like more and why  teavana or adagio

s&w is a much better value  lbs for     vs    lbs for     at cc

so it  no secret that this game has additional input latency on switch compared with other platforms that makes the game a frustrating experience sometimes  i bought it on pc and the experience was way better and i feel motivated on there to play more than on switch 
however like with rocket league do you think it  posible to make some noise so the developer notices this issue and solve it  i tried communicating with vicarious visions support but i wasn   able to make it

since everyone here was so wonderful in suggesting games for my husband which i know was a hard task i   back asking for game ideas for myself   i   looking for a game with an open world to explore with great graphics     but nothing where i have to fight  i   not against blood and gore and i don   get motion sickness like my husband  i just have very high anxiety and don   need to add to it   right now i   looking at yonder and spirit of the north but i read that the graphics in spirit of the north are blurry when played on the handheld which is how i usually play  
i   also open to other games especially puzzlers   games i  enjoyed in the past are the professor layton games ace attorney games lego my favorite ones especially lego indiana jones  zero escape last window and arcade type puzzle games   right now i   playing animal crossing new horizons   just nothing with enemies i have to battle or operate with a timer  i love time management games but they can really make my anxiety spike

i used to drink over a gallon of water daily and not so much because i was thirsty but because i just thought drink lots of water every single day was how you stayed healthy  i work a physical job for   hours a days five days a week sweating alot and before my shift i  found back over a gallon of water and i didnt have alot of stamina and if i dicided to get some water during break i  come back feeling worse  the boxes that i lifted felt very heavy and i was gaining weight probably water weight most likely  i noticed my face would bloat and my skin would look pale and my stomach would expand to  
i read about how too much water was unhealthy so i lowered my intake to  liters on monday and before my shift i drank powerade or iced tea or vitamin water and my energy increased alot  my stomach doesn   expand i lost    pounds on the scale face is no longer puffy skin isnt pale  i can lift the heavier boxes with no issue and my energy last all shift  so before my shift during break and afterwards i  either have powerade or vitamin water or iced tea and it quenches my thirst  i don   urinate as much either  and my legs no longer feel heavy or sluggish 
why is this has it something to do with my electrolytes  
 water just seems to go right through me for some reason

i recently moved into a new place and i   getting a little coffee bar setup but the place where we ' re putting it doesn   have an outlet nearby  i was planning to run an extension power strip and plugin my fellow ekg & encore but i believe i read something on this sub once that it could be a bad idea  
​
is this a bad idea  should i find somewhere else to put it  
​
i could also plug in the grinder on another outlet so they don   pull from the same circuit but the encore is    w which is way lower than      w for the ekg didn   seem like it would be too big of a deal but i have no idea how any of this works

i  tried and failed to get   games working with dosbox  the games are screamer   and network q rac rally championship  with screamer   i managed to run the setup program but the game itself wouldn   load  with network q the setup would not display any options 
are all games this hard to set up through dosbox  is there a gui for dosbox where i can select a game and it will apply the right settings i e  processor type and cycles soundcard etc  and then load the game 
if the presets get created and uploaded and rated by the users it doesn   seem like it would be a hard thing to put together  it  be nice to be able to load a game with one or two clicks  the best thing to breathe life back into those old games would be to make them easily launched and played and unfortunately i  been having no luck 
tl dr   if anyone can help me setting up dosbox with the above two games that would be really appreciated  i would love to play them again and this time maybe with my ps  joypad but we   cross the joypad river when we get to it 
i went to hobby lobby with my mom last night and we got to the cooking section  she mentioned she wished she  gotten into cake decorating earlier in her life because she doesn   see a point in starting it now that her kids are grown      i mentioned something with  at least you never got into a multi level marketing scheme   
she  gone to a lot of stampin '  up parties she  got a lot of pampered chef products but she  never become a distributer  she said she didn   understand how su was a pyramid scheme but was totally on board with pampered chef being one  and then she said something i  never known   you know we did the pyramid scheme thing one time  
turns out right after they got married my mom and dad signed up for amway  luckily they realized very quickly that making money was impossible and they got out with very little money lost  but they were military and mom told me she also came very close to becoming a mary kay seller at one point  it seems that mlm people prey on the stay at home military wives simply because most of them are too young to know any better  honestly all the people on my facebook friends list who are mlmers got married super young like right out of high school young and or are military spouses  and it  very easy to sell the whole  help your husband out   thing  
she also mentioned longaburger  which i know i   not spelling correctly  baskets  she said that might have been the most tempting one

so animal crossing looks very interesting to me but the fact that it  in real time doesn   fit with my schedule because i can really only play at night and for short periods  if at all   so i was looking for games with a similar system that don   use real time and that i don   already have

hi guys  this is my first post on here since i really only started getting serious about tea over the summer and even began gong fu brewing  as of right now puerh has to be my favorite type of tea but i   having a tough time finding different flavor profiles  i have      menghai toucha puerh a general  puerh  from mcnultys nyc and a non descriptive puerh cake from the green tea house  my problem is that they all smell and taste the exact same  earthy soil clay smooth rich   
i like them but i would like to try different types  anyone know where i should start looking for different flavor profiles and questions to ask before i buy by next batch of puerh 
fyi i   pretty sure the puerh i have is raw  i use boiling water and about     grams per  oz of water 
i want it  i want it bad  
if i meet someone that has it is it possible to copy it from their console using a flash drive or something 
the switch is the clear leader in units sold   however as one who uses it almost exclusively for triple a gaming  eg nba  k mortal kombat need for speed  on the go i wish there were far more major games on the console   i think what  holding it back is that it  capabilities are midway between the xbox     and the xbox one   triple a games today increasingly target the xbox series x or ps  as gamers transition to the new generation of consoles   triple a games for the time being still play on the xbox one ps  consoles 
the problem with the switch is that triple a games generally require more power than it is capable of to run decently 
i think if nintendo releases a switch that  has the power of the xbox one x or ps  pro we will see way more triple a games on it   for example if the next switch has a gpu at   teraflops with a processor equivalent in power to the xbox one x or ps  pro and has a     p oled screen with    gb of ram  i think we would see the floodgates open of triple a games coming to the switch   that type of mobile gaming device would be breathtaking and certainly the power would be close enough that developers would port their triple a games on it 
what do you think   do you think the next switch can have those specs   do you think more triple a games would come to the switch if it had those specs or were more powerful

i was thinking about trying it but am apprehensive about whether it needs long play sessions to get much out of it  
one of the great things about switch obviously is jumping in and out of games is super convenient and games like smash and fe h are very compatible with that style of gaming

hey all,
i was wondering if any of you had suggestions for a cheap speaker setup for the ps  that i can plug into it  optical port  there are a few threads about this but they ' re atleast a year old now so i decided a make a new one  currently i just use a headphone connected to the controller     mm jack and i believe if the optical speaker system is too expensive i   just buy cheap pc speakers and connect them to my controller jack when i need it 
i just purchased a turtle beach recon    wired headset and everyone in my party can hear me however i can   hear them  i have already updated my controller and when i unplug it and plug it back in i can briefly hear them before it cuts off to silence again  please help thanks
even if it was just a small discount on a game or something   it takes so much effort to get platinum i feel like there should be a small reward 
just curious if anyone else has made the same mistakes i have and what they have done on their end if anything 
i had bought a used ps  with a copy of p t  on it from someone off ebay a while back  played it loved it everything is great 
in an incredible act of foolishness and blind ignorance on how sony set up digital licenses for games i accidentally made this ps   my first and only one mind you  my primary  as such booted the original user  account prompting a sign in in order to get the digital license for p t  verified 
yes  i am an idiot 
i  tried contacting the original owner without any success  don   blame them  and i   just trying to resign myself to never playing it again even though the file is on the hdd  so close yet so far  i tried looking for emulators and aside from a well known fake  pcsx   the only official development  orbital  is a long way off from booting games  i   not totally familiar with jailbreaking but what i  read seems to indicate that you need to keep the system software down instead of up to date  guess who was also stupid enough to install updates  and obviously — not having downloaded the license to my psn there  no way to use the proxy method to download another copy  the file is still on the system but it  just locked  and i   not about to try and hack into this person  psn that wouldn   be right 
i   guessing i   the only one stupid enough to have done this but here  the moral of the story  if you get a copy of p t  that you do not own it is in your best interest to just avoid connecting your account to that ps   or just online in general  you may accidentally revoke the old license and be stuck with a locked p t  the only solace i have now is playing through kh  
i can   see myself putting     for anthem but for     i totally would 
not really interested in your opinion about the game itself just curious if it could be on sale quickly 
i have been brewing speciality coffee since last may  recently a friend of mine picked up brewing and made me a cup  i was impressed  the cup was fantastic  quite frankly it was better than what i was producing despite having brewed much more  
i would note that my friend used a french press and coffee ground by the roaster whereas i use freshly ground beans in a hario mini mill and a v    
could the cup my friend produced have been better due to the grind quality  or perhaps due to a better knowledge of grind size on the part of the roasters 
so on my steam today i check the store page for tpp and it says at this moment   day and    hours that would mean       tomorrow here in norway that cannot be right  i  read that the game releases at midnight nz time globally that cant mean in the evening for us here in scandinavia  any info on this

  hours later i was still playing a link to the past and now here i am sitting at the office wanting to get home to play a    year old game on a brand new switch with both botw and oddyssey sitting on it

i bought a new blend  rocket fuel by tynemouth coffee company   when i grind it throws coffee grounds everywhere causing a mess and wasting coffee 
i  used two other blends in this machine  alcafé italian and ouseburn foundry number    and they work fine  it  why i   hesitant to say it  static since those blends don   cling to the side of the outlet and get thrown everywhere  maybe the beans are just oily and cling 
any tips for reducing static in a sette     so i can be sure

i have a ps  pro connected to the psvr and an external hdd  the psvr is connected using the usb port on the back while the external hdd is connected using one of the ports in the front  now i recently got the wireless platinum headset which connects using a usb stick  the problem is the sound cuts off frequently and upon looking for a solution i found that many people have this problem when an external hdd is connected to the other port  that means i have to disable and disconnect my external hdd whenever i want to use the wireless headset  i could plug the external hdd on the back but it means i  have to disconnect the psvr from the front and it amounts to the same problem  it also means i   constantly unplugging the plugging multiple devices in the first port   charting controllers and the headset  honestly this is really frustrating  i  looked up usb hubs for ps  pro and while they are available they don   work with the external hdd and the sound problems continue to persist  does anyone have a solution to all this  i hope they include additional ports on the ps

i  been wanting a new monitor for a while and thinking about the asus    hz     p ips g sync one just to not have to buy a new one for a loooong time  i  read that you should have your games framerate locked slightly lower than your refresh rate  so if you have a   hz monitor lock your framerate at    or something so you minimize screen tearing  i  also seen some people claim that some games run worse on higher refresh rate monitors because it  locked at    and therefore the frames that are being output aren   matching up with the monitor 
so i would like some clarification if that  okay  for example if i set my refresh rate at    hz in the nvidia control panel and then played a game that was locked at    fps like fallout   for example would the game run smoother at a   hz monitor or even on a    hz monitor but set at    hz or would it not matter at all 
thanks

i can   believe i slept on this first person mode so awesome 
so me and my friend started playing this together at the same time and same quest yet when i returned to my solo game i retained my money  cars  clothes etc but my quest line had not progressed at all and thus i don   have the rewards from them  anyone else experience this problem  
i love ogame but it  such a stressful game that requires your full devotion to play  i  love something similar that i can play in the background at work  any suggestions 
they   show old pics of when they were  poor and struggling  and then miraculously became rich and traveling all over  they   say message for more info  and amazingly there will be tons of comments requesting info  how are so many people still so gullible 
i can   replay a game i bought without paying  that  not very consumer friendly 
i   in love with a&w  diet cream soda but despite repeatedly complaining to my local safeway they still refuse to stock more than a few boxes at a time   since i   not the only person who likes this soda it  basically impossible to buy enough of it unless i drive around to several different grocery stores 
i would love to just order like    or    boxes online but everywhere i look it costs several times as much as safeway   safeway charges like    a box but online the cheapest i can find is     a box plus shipping   amazon  where i have prime for free shipping  is even worse 
so i was wondering if anyone know of a good site to purchase soda at a reasonable price  ie  at least close to safeway  price so maybe       per box before shipping    again i don   mind if i have to buy a ton of boxes at once i just want a decent price 
i know most aren   the biggest fan of k cups and rightfully so  but i  love to get a list of brands who make killer coffee and also offer it in a k cup 
any help is appreciated 
the arabian shopping zone is sweden based and carries the swedish variety but they have had mixed reviews 
i am looking for those specific varieties is because they are full sugar not watered down with artificial sweeteners and they use the modern packaging  
i have never tried this beverage and i do not want my first try to be disappointing 
after trying orange lucozade energy i know not to bet on the british made things because the artificial sweeteners have thrown off the flavour and i don   want to try an inferior vimto when there are better variations out there 
for any help or advice you all may point me to thanks in advance

i bought this tea set in a hidden antique shop in downtown suwon south korea  my girlfriend and i left the house in the morning with the single intention of buying a traditional korean tea set  we found many but this one was my final choice  i have no idea if it is actually an antique or who made it  i don   speak korean but i   exhausting what resources i have  
the only identifying marks on the set are stamps on the bottom of the cooling bowl and the tea pot  my girlfriend  korean  says it  a chinese symbol which koreans use occasionally particularly in earlier times  i tried my best to make an ink stamp of the mark but i couldn   get it to register well  
any questions about tea korea anything please ask

anyway i tried to make some chai simple syrup using   tbsp chai mix   cups water and   cups muscovado  i tried it in latte form by mixing   ttbsp of the syrup i made with half a cup of milk over ice  the problem is that the syrup tastes just like simple syrup with not even a whiff of chai  what do y ' all suggest i do so i can make the syrup taste more like a muscovado chai concentrate than just muscovado syrup 
hi everyone,
i have just acquired a rocket appartamento  hx machine with copper boiler  and i am absolutely pleased with this machine  
in the search of giving it an adequate maintenance i decided on using only bottled water in it  since rocket advises against descaling processes i  selected a brand that has a very low calcium rate   only  mg l  the rate of mg   is at  , mg l 
however while reading about water qualities on various websites i discovered that  too soft  water can apparently lead to corrosion on copper tubings   type   copper pitting   
hence i am requesting your advice on the following 


is the water that i   using  too soft  for my appartamento  


if yes what is the hardness and or composition you recommand for both avoiding corrosion and scaling  


thanks in advance for your help 
the members of r neverbrokeabone have committed great sins in not only consuming copious amounts of milk but in promoting their scandalous lifestyle  i say it is high time we inform them of the saving knowledge of good ol '  h   
early access for some folks who have origin access subscriptions etc  myself included for better or worse  has gone live    early  i can confirm myself that ray tracing dxr is nowhere to be seen 
hoping that a day  negative one patch resolves it but still  wished marketing from nvidia dice ea were ahead of this considering all the buzz with nvidia  rtx series graphics cards and how much they promoted the tech with this game 
i thought it started out well but the story really declined later on especially when you are forced to play as kelso and the focus shifts for no reason  cole  death was underwhelming af as well the overall story was all over the place
the open world was basically wasted too
i  noticed the last couple of years that  l bottles of barq  have been replaced as coca cola brands root beer by a&w any one know of anyone still carries the  l bottles  i  looked for them the last few years are different grocery stores to no avail 
i urge you to be creative with your opinions 
● how long do you think until we will have fully fledged vr experiences  to the point it   be difficult to tell if it is real life or not  
● how long until we have bodysuits to simulate temperature inside a game or pain when getting shot  obviously not real crazy pain but like a sting and ik not everyone wants this😂     for example the tactile gaming vest developed in university of pennsylvania capable of making the wearer feel punches or gunfire hits in real time  i thought that was real interesting and adds another layer to gaming imagine the intensity of something like battlefield on vr with a tactile vest you never know when you   feel a sting from some direction 
● a combination of all this  vr tactile vests a dome capable of simulating walking synced with the game with some kind of treadmill technology 
imo all these things will obviously happen at some point technology is pretty awesome and if you put yourself in the shoes of someone who lived         years ago most of the tech we have now sounds utterly impossible or even incomprehensible 
all in all i   basically describing a readyplayerone situation 
what do you think  what are your opinions and ideas

i have an aunt that has been roped into one too many mlms  today we were talking about nail polish at christmas dinner when she noticed my nails were chipped  my aunt proceeded with her first line   your nail polish is chipping have you heard of color street  your nail polish would never chip like that  it   last for three weeks   me being the anti mlmer in the family said  i  heard of them however i do not support multi level marketing and i don   plan to buy from them   thinking that was enough to end the conversation  no friends  it was not   why not  it  great quality and you can get two uses out of the strip   again i responded  i   not interested in the product especially the price  if i   paying upwards of     for a packet i  rather buy brand name nail polish   oh you bet she mentioned  they ' re inexpensive and you can get them on sale for    sometimes    so i did what i should have done in the first place make it awkward with the truth  i let my aunt know it  intentional as it  my coping mechanism to pick my nail polish off instead of picking at my face  i have a bothersome acne problem and i  rather pick nail polish from the dollar store off my nails than further damage my skin  i was met with an  oh  and she left the table

i like new york seltzer clearly canadian and kirin lemon 
any thoughts about others like these  carbonated but a relatively light like crispy feeling  and not of course the kind with no calories or only natural flavoring

i  been looking into buying some american sodas but almost every website in the uk buys from the same importer therefore their variety is limited  anyone know where i can buy bottles of us soda  specifically sodas such as faygo or fanta  thanks in advance

i myself never owned a wii u so seeing pokken tournament and mario kart   get ported over to the switch has me happier than ever  i would love to see other top tier nintendo games ported over to the switch so long as they don   act as if they are normal releases for the year  
how is everyone else feeling about wii u games being ported over 
it  so insane it started off with just her plastering everything all over her social media  i got a message asking me to join she tried to cover it up with saying it was a    day fitness challenge  other people have fallen for it and now there  a whole group of huns in my town who used to be my friends  it  like they ' re all hypnotised and don   know how to do their homework  how do i knock some sense into them 
i   new to brewing at home in any method other than k cup and recently got a v   kit gooseneck kettle scale etc  i   following the hoffman method and producing what i perceive to be a good cup of coffee   but it seems like it  too easy for some reason  not in a bragging type way in a i must be missing something way  
i  followed this sub for a while and have read that people spend a lot of time honing their brew which leads me to believe that i just haven   developed the skills to detect nuances in taste and determine what is actually a  good cup  
am i right in thinking that the hoffman method is  easy  and how can a novice judge if they are producing a good cup 
i was surprised to see that game of all things find its way onto switch  it is an endless runner game with zombines very similar to into the dead

hi everyone  so i  never been a fan of the battery set up with xbox but recently i bought a new controller and i   seriously interested in switching to an alternative  i have environmental concerns over the use of non reusable batteries and i  bought pack after pack of rechargeable batteries and they never seem to work after     charges  i was wondering if anyone has had any experience with the rechargeable battery pack that microsoft offers  i   highly considering buying one but i wanted to first just check and see if anyone has any opinions on it 
hey all 
the recent years i  learned to love coffee more and more  at home i  usually had drip coffee from a moccamaster and enjoy it  i  recently moved by myself and have been drinking aeropress coffee for a while but havent really managed to tune it to mys taste  im a big fan of hoffmans french press coffee as well 
i  been looking at pour overs for a while wanting to explore and learn some new techniques  both the chemex and v   pops up a lot but for someone who  never tried any it  hard to decide 
can someone explain the flavour profiles and mouthfeel based on anything i  tried 
i usually brew     cups but i like the idea of brewing more like i could with a     cup chemex  would the coffee get cold when only brewing one cup with the chemex  which one is easier to learn  
i have so many questions so any advice is appreciated 
i noticed that the black one tends to cost more than the daemon x machina version  are there any differences besides colour  i  rather buy the better one 
i do have some question as well 
   can the series x easily hit max frames on series x enhanced games   like halo mcc 
   could i get more bang for my buck from a pc  
  how much do you think i would need to spend to get the full series x experience compared to a pc  
thanks

one of my best friends since childhood is selling monat  the  clean beauty company  she joined is under a different name but they only sell monat  some of the friend group has gently reached out privately to let her know that she should be careful and do further research we told her we won   buy or sell but to let us know if we can support her in other ways  i don   want to hurt her feelings because she is sensitive and seems genuinely excited  she  also a very good friend and has been my entire life we don   want to lose her  but i also know how dangerous mlm  are and how quickly you begin to lose money  
does anyone have experience or advice with this  we ' re only    and she is too smart to be girl bossing 
i  like to get rid of the roaches but salvage the machine  the only guides i  found don   pertain to the k    and the build has no real intuitive places to start with other than the screws on the bottom  but even after that i can   find any obvious places to pull apart  any help would be appreciated
got my first gaming pc last march after playing console for    years  i stayed on controller for a bit but eventually switched to mouse and keyboard and never looked back 
i recently tried playing apex on my xbox and    wow  i feel like i can barely hit a single shot when playing on controller now  does anyone else have that problem too or am i just struggling to get back into the groove 
i  always loved the sprite artwork for the older games and after link  awakening all i can think of is what a pokémon diamond and pearl remake would look like with that style of graphics  the battles could be their current  d style but the way the overworld looked in the old games just worked so well 
maybe it  just the nostalgia in me but the toy like design of the link  awakening characters reminded me of how everyone looked on the gba ds games and seeing that in hd would look really nice 
what do you all think 
from my first ever what cha order
my personal opinion and i am still learning   
two days ago i have received my first ever what cha order which was quite a karma booster  as few of you wanted to know more about this darjeeling i have brewed it today and now here are some my points 
bag pic

approx    °c tap water  we have really good water but bit hard 
    grams of tea leaves
  minutes steep
    ml mug  edit 
leaf grade  ftgfop 
harvest  april     

well now how to describe it 
smell  floral aroma bit of forest  but not mushrooms 
appearance  long leaves swirly dark green  sometimes bits of leaves itself  not swirled 
inside of bag
colour of brew  clear and gold nothing more to say
just spilled water
done 
taste  similar to smell but more present floral notes with very tasty after taste  like a peaches and apricots not malty at all  i can suggest it to everybody 
edited  added volume of mug
anyone have any comfort grip recommendations 
the switch isn   the most comfortable console to hold for long periods of time  just like the  ds  and was curious if anyone had any experience with any for the switch  
i saw this on amazon it reminds me of the  ds one but there is little to no reviews  link below

just wondering what would happen to all online services for the ps  once they don   exist since they require ps plus 
would you not be able to join someone  would you not be able to go online in public lobbies  just curios this question popped in my mind frequently and i though i would get it off my mind 
i have modded several current gen games as well as older games like witcher skyrim divinity sin   diablo etc etc 
i have tried and used maybe up to     different reshades at this point overtime and i have always tried to like it but i just don   get the point  am i missing something 


  times out of    the reshade presets are over saturated 


the effects are gimmicky and act more like photograph filters you get on social media apps


i generally get better effects with less fps drop just using my graphics card  geforce     super  nvidia panel and turning my monitor on hdr mode or different game modes    ms response black stabilizer etc etc 


fps usually drops anywhere from   to    depending on how many effects and how new heavy they are 


i don   think there has been one preset that actually looked better or improved my gaming experience or quality of the colors better than other non reshade effects 
enb for example on the other hand has completely blown me away and change my gaming experience 
i still feel left out like i don   get what all the hype is about ok reshade  am i missing something 
i   exaggerating about seeing sounds but it seems for me i get hyper aware of everything around me which is kinda cool 
now up to       i can   find any patch notes yet but feels a little smoother looks ever so slightly better and i think they  added some new water effects  i e  the puddles in the other versions are now more obvious on switch    
it  still fairly low res docked so no miracle fix other versions are better etc but does look and play better than it did at launch 
i noticed it few months ago  my xbox is nearly   year  old and performance in a lot of games seems worse than before    is microsoft slowing it down on purpose   i hope not    i did factory reset and clean it from dust but that didn   work 
i   looking to get a lido grinder i don   currently have an espresso machine i use an aeropress or a v   
a friend suggested that if i   going to spend money on a lido i should just get the e because i might eventually get a home espresso machine and then i  be ahead by already having a great grinder 
i know that both the   and e are  full range  grinders my question is how realistic is it to use an e for other brewing methods  
these are the second remakes of the kanto pokemon games after fire red and leaf green and specifically they are remakes of pokemon yellow  they were designed in such a way to allow pokemon go fans to get into the mainline series serving as a bridge of sorts  the initial announcement caused some befuddlement in the gaming community and i can see why  i don   think this is what people had in mind when pokemon was teasing a  brand new rpg for nintendo switch   of course it was later clarified that this wasn   the new rpg in question  one big change that these games brought to the franchise was the removal of random encounters  pokemon are now clearly visible in the overworld and you can engage with them at your leisure aside from the occasional stealthy onix popping in unannounced  but beyond that other talking points arose chiefly the graphics low difficulty and the required motion controls docked or undocked  i  love to hear your thoughts on these games and the aforementioned talking points especially here in the post gen   era

to discourage plastic use and encourage refillable bottles  maybe just for a week  a week where anyone posting a picture of their plastic choked fridge gets their post deleted with a comment explaining that plastic totally sucks and reusable bottles are completely rad  as hydrohomies we should be absolutely against single use plastic bottles 
i used to love her videos   she was always particularly clear about not being mean to other people and talked about the dangers of mlms   yes she was rather verbose at times but i actually found that quite endearing    i loved the fact she  achieved so much at such a young age 
then she announced that she was no longer anti mlm   this was because the community was so mean   this made no sense to me   if you campaigned against modern slavery but you had a spat with another campaigner would you stop being against slavery and say you need to listen more to people traffickers 
she  put up today a long rambling video about how terrible the  community  is   repeating the same things over and over   most of it is meaningless because she  addressing things she doesn   want to talk about    she keeps saying she has evidence of the bullying she  received and she will present it sometime   why not present it now   any anti mlmer i see doing that i will unsubscribe from instantly 
if the community is a  mess  then why not post anti mlm content as an independent campaigner 
update  
i tried it with the window wide open but then the snow turned to rain and the high speed winds blew the rain right into the case  which i had open in hopes of achieve maximum cooling   i   gonna have to play mobile games now
currently i   enjoying tea pigs but looking to try something else the stronger the floral notes the better if anyone  got a recommendation 
i   trying to find a short domed stick for left side  but everyone either makes medium or tall and all including the rare short ones all come as one in an expensive package of other sticks and stuff i don   need 
somebody make and sell a short domed stick for the elite series   controller please

ms x is  my acquaintance  
similar to every beginning of the story i was approached from an acquaintance  she started with what an amazing  ~~job~~ business  she has according to her the following is the gist of conversation we had 

i am a part of this amazing business where i only work less than   hours a day  
those online meetings generally are very fun and motivating  
my organization deals with waste management of various international manufacturing units  
all she was talking about was how stress free fun and amazing her job was 

i was halfway sure this is an mlm yet i neglected  suddenly yesterday ms x called me and informed

ms x    my company is looking for global expansion and i wanted to refer you name if they select you they will schedule an online interview and you will be lucky    
me     how   why   what does you firm work for again      
  during this i was aware that it is an mlm scheme just to see what and how will they explain their process of operations as an waste management organization i said yes    
ms x    all your doubts will be clarified during interview if you are lucky you will ace it    
me   ok lets see what happens sign me up 

​
after a while i get a call from their

hr executive    you should be up for interview tomorrow and we are only giving you this lucky chance only because  ms   x my acquaintance   refereed you so be prepared and make sure you have a pen and paper with you 

​
and during this whole time they were avoiding the name of their organization  i called my acquaintance to know the name of the organization and this is the conversation 

ms x    you will have all of your answers tomorrow during interview make sure you have a pen and paper with you   
me    oh  so you are not even disclosing the name this seems fishy  i think you guys are going to ask me for investment also    
she    yes but only if you get selected in the interview 

so to invest my money in an organization where they dont disclose even their name i need to attend the interview 
so i am going to be attending the interview on zoom since they said i can ask any questions during interview please give me some questions to ask from mlm side as i forgot to mention the main issue here
 drum roll please        
 i am by profession an environmental engineer i have masters in environmental engineering and management   waste management is a part of my masters   and this so called waste management organization is going to explain me how they are  managing wastes 
​
please drop mlm and waste management related questions to ask them 
​
tl dr   i was  lucky  to be considered for interview with a new organization which is expanding globally [which i have confirmed is an mlm]  i need some questions to ask them during interview 
 st up i did search and didn   see any posts like mine 
lan parties are heaps of fun and they got me thinking back to good old times  it would be amazing to see a renaissance of many old multiplayer games like halo  , ,  quake unreal tournament counterstrike tf  left for dead conker  bad fur day battlefront   spy vs spy etc  then there  the ones that are closer than impossible like golden eye and perfect dark 
the switch makes me believe in a world where super easy lan parties happen everywhere  even on a plane you and your obviously   loaded  friends can play games together on a    hr flight 
tl dr old great games that are near impossible to ever re release on the ns would make super easy & fun lan parties with     people  
post any great multiplayer game i missed 
i bought almost all my games physical rather than digital  i liked having physical copies to share with my friends and to keep them for a long time  until now  i never considered this could happen but i lost my copies of just dance      and mario kart  i was traveling and i   suspecting airport security stole it from my bag  i remember packing it on my way back but i can   find it anywhere in the house 
have you lost your games before  how do i cope 😭 i have so many games i want to buy and i don   have that much money to pay for the same game twice 
now i see why people prefer digital  it won   go anywhere  unless nintendo decides down the line i guess but still  
i am just curious to know if any of you thought your friend actually wanted to hang out just to find out you ' re in the middle of a  mlm sales pitch  did you stay  to be polite  or just leave telling them you ' re not looking to buy stuff   
where can i find a replacement burr for the timemore g s 
i make my own seltzer and have a plethora of stainless steel bottles and growlers  just curious when the revolution will start to flow 
hey everyone 
my parents are thinking about signing up with vivent  does anyone know if this is an mlm  its not on the mlm list but looks similar  thanks 
so when i boot up halo infinite on my series s i get a ton of screen tearing and the game goes black and turns back on a few seconds later this happens all the time and randomly  it is important bare in mind this only happens in performance mode or on    hz mode on the series s if i change to quality mode  which has such low fps it is unplayable  or change to   hz mode  which takes too long when all i want to do is play my game  it fixes itself    but that  not what i want  i want to be able to go into my game without having to touch the display settings and keep them the same regardless of the game 
anyone know what i should do i just want a way to play this game without having issues like this 
i already have an encore for my drip aeropress application but now i need an espresso grinder  oe still doesn   have any lido e  in stock right now and i can get a vario used for       what is your take on this situation  i have not seen any good head to head comparisons of the two for espresso applications  thanks

hey you  have you been drinking too much water lately  do you have a sodium deficiency  or are you just craving more salt after all that water  try drinking sea water  it contains plenty of sodium and h o  stop having to worry about betraying the hydro homies code and chug some sea water today 
what ever happened to sprite zero  nothing in stores except the big bottles 
there  so much information about how toxic mlms are  so many people are against them now  how are people still falling for this  i   hoping one day the huns will realize we are against it and stop messaging us 
i  been planning on doing this for a while now but i want to go for some more exotic teas as apposed to the generic english breakfast   etc etc  thanks in advanced for your input

just received confirmation that my joy cons made it to nintendo repairs  also seeing if they   do something about the kickstand issue has anyone received joy cons back since they announced free repairs  i wonder if they are repairing them or replacing them entirely   
edit   
just received confirmation my switch joy cons will be arriving in two days  i was expecting to wait a bit longer  a lot of people are saying they are getting entirely new joy cons  i also sent my switch in to have the back of the case replaced  the nintendo rep said if the system itself was damaged in anyway they would ask to charge me     for the repair  doesn   look like they did  i   have another update on the experience after my console and controllers are received  thanks to everyone for answering asking question 
edit    just received the   joy cons i sent in  looks like they ' re all new  also my switch arrives tomorrow  no cost for repairing the cracked housing

this man is an absolute legend 
hes removed the   fps cap from the kyrpt fatalities x rays intros and the menu 
hes also somehow completely fixed ultra wide for the game removing the black bars from the side of the screen 
also hes now looking into a way to remove the film grain 
i   don   believe he has a patreon or anything set up but if you love  mk    and pc gaming ide highly suggest showing him some love any way  you  can  without him we might have seen an ultrawide patch    months  from  now and we would surely never see the fps cap removed by nrs

hi i am a    year old a student who is currently in second year taking engineering course in university  i am neither an  anti  or a big fan of mlm  but i have read your stories regarding amway recruiters and its scheme and i can relate to some of the part of what you guys experience  because of that i would like to share about my experience with amway recruiters who one of them is my friend who is currently studying university as well with me   let  name her  s    
it all started when i was texted by  s  who is currently in amway for less than a year  i   not so sure when she joined   she texted me saying that she have a business and would like me and my sister to be a part of it and she asked if we could meet and talk about it with her  group   she haven   mention  amway  at that time   so i said sure and met up with her at the library  when i met up with  s  at the library she said  let  wait for my group to get started   once her group arrive she started presenting with the flashcards and a book and excitedly she said  do you guys know what business that can give us that lifestyle      it  amway   i never heard of amway before and i do not have any knowledge or experience with business at all   of course i was curious and hear what she have to said further while my other friend who has a business background knew about this and said  no  as she have her own online business and much other things to do and she left as she was hurried to go home  
 s  began telling me about this business and asked me if i would become her business partner  because i am a person who would think first before making any decision  i told her that i would think about it  while waiting for my decision  s  brought me along with her to the small shop of  amway   to look around and introduced me to her further upline to ask her questions and get to know more on amway   it  more like a qna session or  interview  sessions  the upline first asked me about my dream what would i do with infinite time and money how much do i really want this kind of dream  then she asked if i have a side income or side job and told me how amway can give me that opportunity   freedom of time and money  that evening after the session  s    upline texted me if i am free to meet up with her through zoom call to talk about it  
in the zoom call firstly  s    upline she asked me to list the names of people that i know that fit into their certain criteria i played along with her instruction and before ending the call she told me to ask them to meet up with me with her  i was in confusion like wtf   i haven   even made my decision to join amway and  s  was even more excited thought that i    joining  amway  i told  s  that i haven   made my decision yet   s  suggested me to join the business preview that would  blow  my mind  
because  s  wanted a answer from me sooner i went to ask for opinions from family and my long distance friends on what do they think on amway and i did my research on amway and its mlm scheme  sure enough i got not so good review on the business scheme while the products are good quality yet expensive  so i said no to both of them  s  and her upline   s  was okay about it while her upline was sort of pushy in my opinion where she asked me to just pay and join as a business owner with not doing any business  i ghosted the upline and i thought that was it  but no  it happened again   luckily that it ended sooner than i expected  
do let me know if you guys wanna know the second part of it

my hometown has been infiltrated by paparazzi huns  thankfully i moved away after high school but my facebook feed is just live videos showing the most hideous costume jewelry   only    lead and nickel free     is this really a selling point  they ' re also all super defensive of their  business  which is never a good sign 
i  been getting a ton of friend requests from girls i never even spoke to when we were in high school  now i have to check their profiles to see if they ' re involved in this  i guess that this is a sign to do some friends list cleanup    
i guess it  also important to mention that my hometown is next to one of the largest military bases in the country so many of these girls are stay at home military wives  it  just so predatory of mlms to target these vulnerable girls

my grandfather built his house over an artesian well sometime in the     s   fast forward to the     s when i was first offered coffee as a teenager   percolated in a corningware stovetop percolator with pre ground eight o ' clock arabica coffee purchased at the grocery store it was the best never since duplicated coffee experience i have ever had   the water used was vile   that well water was actually tinted grey with iron and had the most terrible rotten egg smell    drink this it  really healthy for you   my brother would say   i couldn   drink it and could hardly even stand to bathe in it   so how did my grandmother make such divine coffee  and tea  with such vile water with no filtration  she was a simple farm woman  a top notch seamstress and cook  and certainly did not have access to a lot of the mod cons we enjoy today   she broke every single rule of coffee making that were touted even in     s cook books  you should have seen the inside of the percolator   eek   and yet still made memorable coffee   i am flummoxed 
my wife is pregnant and she doesn   want to have a ton of caffeine but loves coffee  she can taste the difference between decaf and caffeinated coffee and has tried many decaf k cups and cannot find one that tastes good

so i recently started drinking green tea because i heard it would boost my metabolism among other health benefits  my dad bought me     pack of lipton green tea the kind in bags that you steep for like     minutes  i find that the taste is a little bitter for my liking so i add a small teaspoon of sugar and i stir it in  despite this my tea seems quite bitter but as i get closer to the bottom it gets sweeter like all the sugar just decides it wants to be down there  is there something i   doing wrong  does the sugar not want to mix evenly  should i even be drinking this with sugar  
tldr   my sugar always sits at the bottom of my lipton green tea

within the first hour you have to escape in a ship which leads to the game staying in a loading screen indefinately after finishing the mission  it  even more annoying because you have to trek to the city watch multiple unskippable cut scenes slowly trudge through corridors and do a escape chase where hitting an obstacle once will send you back to a check point  the mission was pretty humorous the first time but i was ready to uninstall after i got locked three times after finishing the mission
i found out that you have to turn on airplane mode in your switch then in the last stretch where one of the characters jokes about  barrel rolls  you spam the barrel roll move until the mission ends  the game loaded properly after that

does anyone else get the impression that the  ' nindies '  thing is nintendo encouraging smaller developers to make switch games that are reminiscent of their old  b list  ip without having to directly use that ip and tie a potentially bad game to the series name 
examples 


fast rmx is literally f zero with a different name and is switch exclusive  nintendo clearly have no interest in making another actual f zero game as there hasn   been one since the gamecube but they could easily have encouraged a smaller developer to make something that will attract the same player base but on a much lower budget 


steamworld dig   even refers to itself as  metroidvania like 


yooka laylee is literally banjo kazooie  iirc it  even most of the same developers 


wargroove couldn   be more advance wars if it tried   i mean   the setting got a reskin but just look at the art style and animations  


i know not every nindie is a switch exclusive and i   aware this probably sounds like a mad conspiracy theory but is it really so far out of the question for nintendo to contract smaller dev teams and say  so here  an idea     
ps  brand exploration by u madebystudiojq #madebystudiojq #playstation  #ps 
logomark on console prototype  some tweaks still to be made to the p 
my take on how i would approach the ps  brand 
the  idea of the segments of the type to break up and evolve the brand  to  come   adding a subtle gradient which could be used in loading time  technology 
more to come

since mountain dew liberty brew came out me and my family have been trying to think where have we tasted something like this before  after thinking a while it hit my cousin about the good old nc tarheel blue soda  anyone else get the vibe from that  it  almost like a second coming  hope liberty brew comes back for years to come 
i   debating on getting this game as i have been itching for a baseball game and the switch is the only system i have  i  seen gameplay videos of it to me it looks ok but i loving simulating seasons  is this a deep enough game that i can sim through seasons after seasons with drafting and all that offseason stuff  been going back and forth on this game that will really help me decided to get this or not  thanks

not anxious about water but anxiety as a side effect
i got a series s a few weeks ago and have slowly discovered that none of the accessories battery pack mobile gaming clip  i had for xb   controller fit the s  controller 
i don   know if this is the right place to post this since it  a meme page  but this is a real question someone here might be able to answer 
so i love water  i  carried around a    oz nalgene with me for like the past    years and usually fill it up twice a day so i   probably taking in about   liters a day  when i drink less than that i get cramps and a bad headache  if i wait too long in the day to drink i   also get those symptoms  my headache and cramps eventually go away when i drink enough water  i have a hard time eating a meal if i don   have any water to go with it  
sometimes i just wonder if i have an unhealthily excessive dependence on water  if i don   have it or even as much as i normally have i seem to get  withdrawals   does anyone know if that is even possible  
side note i just remembered this as i was typing  i use to get anxious if i didn   have my water bottle  i realized that drinking water became a sort of coping mechanism because i would hold on to my nalgene and take lots of sips in situations where i was nervous uncomfortable  i think i  moved past that but now i   wondering if there could be some psychological explanation as well  i   open to any and all of your thoughts 
first i  upgraded from windows   to     games worked kinda ok  lost a few fps here and there  but had a bunch of other problems  explorer exe kept crashing etc '  
i  decided to do a clean install   luckily  windows    got a  reset this pc  option that deletes everything to the original state  that worked but everything was slower  i don   think that the common user would notice it but it was noticeable to me  
pages in chrome took more time to process  even opening the settings page took a few seconds or a new tab  right clicking on things took a few seconds etc '  etc '   then i noticed that i lost over    fps in batman  another symptom was that videos on youtube with     p   fps would drop frames like crazy on full screen 
very skeptic i went a head and did a real clean install from a thumb drive   beware you have to upgrade first to get your windows    key then you can clean install 
guess what everything is solved  i   now getting a solid       on batman  before that i got    while gliding   with the same nvidia driver 
chrome is back to its original state youtube works great and everything feels snappier  
do your self a favor windows    users  do a clean install 
will i be able to transfer my p t  demo installation when upgrading from a standard ps  to ps  pro 
i like to try a wide variety of teas and inevitably i end up with some that i don   really like  what are some good ways to put them to use 
hey everyone i am just curious due to covid more people work from home on the computers do you still play mostly on pc or have you moved on play more on consoles 
thanks
just a question if anyone knows if the ifruit app for dealing with chop is going to get support for the pc version of gta v in the future   or is using the app not really worth it in terms of game play advantages for the dog 
i need to make a survey to help determine the feasibility of a potential business for my entrepreneurship course  i figured  r soda was the best place to get my data  only   questions  please and thank you   
http   goo gl forms moj rsgoyi
i  had some sodas that i wanted to keep leak and ruin alot of things and i want to know where can i preserve them to where they don   explode or leak 
in this wikipedia article it lists all of the crush flavors 
in the list you can see  ' crush chocolate '  but it isn   cited and i can   find anything about it 
the existence of this mythical soda is interesting to me can anyone verify or disprove it  existence 
i   about to go to college and i need to pick the one i want soon  right now my options are wsu  in state  and university of idaho i was accepted into the university of oregon but it  way to expensive  recently i  thought about opening up a coffee roaster that  a job i would genuinely love doing  my question is what would be the better college for that and what are the kind of majors and minors i   need to look for   definitely business  my last question is probably is this a good career option  it  something i would love doing everyday probably open up a coffee shop or maybe a couple later  what  the chances of failure  is the pay good enough  do i have time off  i was going to be a doctor but i  been shadowing at my local hospital and realised i would hate it 
had the same problem with my xbox one however i figured the controllers headphone jack was broken since it was like   years old however i got a brand new series x and they still do it  they work fine with my ps  and switch but always make a loud screeching noise on xbox does anyone in this sub know how to fix it 
so i  recently got the new xbox series x and i need the new play and charge kit for the controllers but i  ordered the original v  from xbox one does this work with the next gen controllers or do i need to order the newer v  
so i recently got a     gift card to amazon com and decided i  get some of my favorite imported soda from scotland irn bru   as i was checking out i noticed this option

i can   explain it well but the idea that it  portable but that doesn   mean you ' re confined to the portable  screen  cause anywhere that has a dock and a tv screen you can play 
i feel like they taste like nothing  and no i don   have covid  they just leave a dry sweet aftertaste and i get sick of it after less than a half of a    ml can 
for me it was gears tactics  i loved the first few hours of that game but after chapter   i got completely bored  the obligatory side missions was the final nail in the coffin 
if you don   own a ps  and want to know how many hours did you play on your games there  a solution 
on pc download and install the playnite app and connect it with your sony account  it will import your account data games you own and it will show some data on it including how many hours you have on it 
if you also game on pc you can import steam origin epic games data and check how many games you own and even launch pc games directly from the app

today and onward i am going to try to embrace the life of a hydro homie and i wean myself off of the dirty sinners drink as much as possible
admittedly new to the coffee game but i  done a bit of reading and am looking for a good end game grinder or at least one that will last    years not including maintenance like inevitable burr replacements  budget is   ,    but that doesn   mean i   not against getting a niche zero which is probably by far the best value pick and is the one i   most familiar with  i tend to favor clear and fruity flavors so i guess i have a light roast profile and probably prefer pour overs and espressos with the occasional fp  besides a niche zero what are other grinders that i should consider  i   not really the type to spend a lot of time to continuously experiment with different settings except to find the top     optimal setups that produce the best tasting coffee for me then jot down the settings for future replication  
here  a few random notes i have though they may not be accurate 


since i   only using the grinder for only myself i guess single dose grinder route is the only option for me  if i don   want stale coffee in the hopper and higher retention that seems to come from commercial cafe style grinders   things like popcorning and retention seems like a concern but are there mods that make commercial high end grinders single dose like that are not otherwise 


niche zero seems like a jack of all trades but not really excelling in any category  e g   good enough  for pour overs but there are better options    of course the main selling point is versatility and ease of use at an excellent price point  i   willing to trade a some convenience for more quality grinds  e g  i   not switching between pour over and espresso frequently  maybe every     months or so  so that might eliminate the drawback of having to re configure the grinder for the type of coffee method as a consideration  


niche zero is conical whereas it seems flat burrs is ideal way to go for light roasts  and arguably in general now due to the improvements in design  


ek   seems to be the gold standard and most popular end game grinder but numerous users say the resulting espresso does not go too well with milk and is far better consumed straight  it  also not single dose 


i  also things heard about monolith conical flat and eg    i   not opposed to the idea of modding grinders to improve them 
any ideas recommendations are much appreciated 
same rules as coffee  there  a cafe at my job that has a type of oolong tea and then a  dark roast  version of that same tea  would one have more caffeine than the other 
im so sick of everyone being like look i got a graphics card  it sucks not living next door to a micro store i have been trying over a year to get one and not resort to scalpers this is making my joy of gaming almost gone because i can   really build a new pc since my pc is  amd  k series
i want to order masala chai tea from adagio but don   really know how to make chai as i always drink plain black tea with sugar  does anyone have a simple easy to follow guide to make chai from loose leaf chai tea as far as steeping and milk go  
and while i   posting has anyone tried the peach or apricot black tea from adagio  i can   decide which one to get   
i started gaming when covid peaked  finished rdr  on an ultrawide monitor and it was insanely beautiful and cinematic  why isn   ultrawide gaming more mainstream  it feels like it should be default even tbh   
thoughts 
we are told that for an espresso use the     ratio
when doing a double shot of coffe i have added enough ground coffee for a double
in this case for my    mm portafilter    grams
so my yield going on     should be
   grams ml out 
sounds good right 
yet we are told
a single shot is  oz or   ml grams
a double shot is  oz or   ml grams
yet using the     ratio my yield ends up being    grams ml on a double basket
that  less than  oz    ml grams  which is the amount of a double shot 
so shouldn   the ratio of water be higher i e 
   x to get me  oz    ml  i e    
something like
     
to get  oz   ml grams 
or are we always getting less than  oz   ml and the term double only refers to the coffee ground and not the yield ratio
microsoft has a series s and x  maybe they will release an e  🤣 it could be a handheld game streaming device to compete with the switch 
like a small device you could plug in or easily connect to your monitor 
i was hacked recently  the hacker stole my email and eventually got my xbox live account  i spent about a week working with the xbox support team on getting my account back  i finally get my account back and i feel relieved  finally some good luck on my side  but nope   i go to play some battlefield   with some friends and i notice i can   play so i told my online buds  that i   be right back as i turn off my console and turn it back on when i go to sign back online it says my account has been suspended i go online and see what my suspension is all about    microsoft has banned me until             
i was apparently banned for sending users messages about account theft and asking for personal information  something the hacker must have been doing while my account was hijacked  
i admit i   furious  i have held this account for years and when i called xbox support i had expected them to help me in this situation they tell me that the xbox live enforcement team handles these situations separately from support and that they are not authorized to make decisions for my issue they also informed that the enforcement team doesn   have a support number and that i would have to make an appeal ticket and they will ultimately decide on the fate of my account an account that i had since i was a young gamer in middle school and now i   in my second year of college  
i   feeling like my chances of getting my account unbanned are slim to none at this point considering i can   reference the support team in this situation 
i   desperately asking the  r xbox subreddit community for advice on this situation or to simply share your story if you were in a similar situation as i am 
i   trying to keep my hopes up but this has been such a stressful time for me 
i   playing it on my series s and putting aside some glitches  that most of the time feels like part of the cyber experience  it  a pretty cool game 
it  the most  rock n '  roll  game i  ever played  not counting guitar hero or rock band   what are your thoughts 
just got a delonghi bean to cup coffee machine 
its great  the only first world problem we have is that  there are no separate decaf normal options 
we love coffee but wouldn   want to drink   cups worth of caffeine every day 
do you have any tip or trick to make life easy and be able to make both normal decaf on demand 
do you just put in a very small amount of beans at a time 
maybe there  no magic trick but thought i  ask you smart people
i am thinking of getting the fastest time warner cable connection which is rumored to be     mbps in ny la later this spring   does anyone have fios or google fiber or equivalent and can confirm the fastest speed for downloads 
edit   thanks everyone for your input   
all of the f e a r games are said to have been added to the xbox backwards compatibility but i am only seeing   and    is anyone else noticing this 
for me it  animal crossing  having it digital means i can always switch to it whenever i get the urge to catch bugs shake a tree or just wander about 
​
some games really do feel better when purchased digitally because they can be quickly accessed and i was wondering which ones you all go to 
this is my first time posting here so if this gets deleted for some reason i wont be surprised   
anywho this was my first time home brewing intelligentsia  i was never fond of them the few times i  tried them in shop to say the truth   however it was the only decent brand that was available at the market  i have been brewing in a chemex for roughly a year  not everyday  and at one point i felt like i got pretty decent at getting results that tasted well balanced  
i do      g of coffee    g of ice and    g of water
  ml bloom for    secs     
some things i have noted 
the beans are already grounded and the expiration is fine til next month
the bloom seems very weak   when pouring it seems like it just totally absorbs everything and the water seeps through the grind  i try to swirl it but nothing helps aside from adding more water  i have heard this could be due to storing in a humid environment or b c its pre ground 
the first few brews were not good  i brewed around   minute mark  very    bitter and it was almost like i could barely taste a hint of any other flavor
the last time i tried i got a really heavy gasoline like overwhelming taste that almost felt like it was hard to swallow or dry   worst brew of my life
the last time before this i brewed tectonic coffee and every brew was so fruity and elegant and delightful 
if anyone can point me in a direction that would be greatly appreciated
i downloaded halo infinite on steam a week ago and i hadn   been able to play since my account wasn   authorised  i later located the problem was my age but i couldn   edit it  for the time being i   playing on an alt microsoft mail  when i try to add my main mail to the alt  family group i can   since i   not authorised to leave the current one  anyone know how i can play it on my main mail 
i  looked through some gameplay videos and loved the soundtrack which along with the gameplay reminded me of oath in felghana rusty hearts  would you recommend it  i don   mind the fan service if the gameplay and boss fights are good  don   know much about the developer only that they also make the atelier games which also have lovely music but rather mundane gameplay  thanks in advance 
you have the hori split pad pro with good ergonomics but no bluetooth gyro or rumble 
you have the binbok with good ergonomics and pretty much all functionality but trash quality control 
all i really need is a quality pair of joycons with good ergonomics and doesn   drift dammit  i just wanna play handheld without sacrificing comfort or some form of functionality 
since teavivre is once again shipping worldwide i decided to buy some green tea  i love huang shan mao feng is there any tea with a similar taste that you would recommend 
i used to buy      packs every week and a couple months ago i was buying      packs of the      oz bottles every few days
now i   buying     packs of the    oz bottles every other day
   but i need a bit of help 
are there any relatively cheap water brands you recommend that don   taste like pure limestone 
is water flavoring a good idea at first or are they just as bad as soda 
i am looking for an online place that will offer less normal coffee so to speak  talking india monsooned malabar geisha whiskey barrel aged etc    
all other variables controlled for the food you eat along with your coffee can have a dramatic effect on your perception of its taste  i just had fruit snacks before taking a sip of my coffee and now i   getting a strong tea taste maybe earl grey    and this is not a cup of gesha  my theory is that whatever food you pair with coffee can be used to subtract that taste from the coffee  so something sweet like a cookie will let you find the earthy or bitter elements of the coffee  and having something savory like salty hash browns will help you pinpoint the fruity notes of your cup  finally i think this works best with room temperature coffee  or at least it  easier to find all the flavors than when it  piping hot 
i swear that  some of the tastiest water out there aside from night water and post workout water
since i began brewing coffee at home i  been hearing a lot that i must brew at nothing below boiling temperature for speciality level roasts 
i  been doing so since a long time and tweaking every other possible variable and i was always not getting what i had hoped for  there was always some harsh lingering bitterness  what some people might call burned taste   only recently did i try brewing at lower temperatures and started getting much better results using my clever dripper  and i had this experience even with a particularly light geisha
i   writing this post because i   so curious why is it recommended to never go below boiling temperatures for other than dark roasts  i   baffled truly
guys  just think about it  nintendo is back in the race for so many reasons  within    hours of the switch preview trailer everyone had seen it  people are interested and the public seems excited about the prospect of gaming with the same games wherever they are  people actually know what this thing is and want it   
secondly third party devs are backing it like crazy and are also excited  bethesda themselves said they would really only support it if the specs were good enough for their games  even if this console misses some aaa games we ' re basically garunteed some amazing multiplats and lots of exclusives   
i just had to remind people how fun this console will likely be 
i bought my xbox     elite in asia and ever since i  moved to canada i haven   been able to even turn on the console because of voltage difference  the asian console is supposed to run at    v but canada delivers only    v  i  tried to find solutions over the past   years but it seems like buying a new power supply and plugging it in might be the best option  the thing is i haven   been able to find a single one of them for sale and most of them say they are only compatible for the     slim  i  been trying to find even a single one for sale but still haven   found any  the other thing is i don   know if this solution will even work since the only hint i  gotten is a forum post from      saying that power supplies can be interchangeable  does anyone know what i can do or am i out of luck   
having a hard time finding an answer to this with the googling  it  mostly about bleached vs  unbleached paper filters  thanks 
we have failed  
we are resorting though enthusiastically  to reddit to tell us the answer  we have run through about     cups of jet fuel in the lab this past month and we need to order a new batch  
we want to know which k cup has the most caffeine content  we will then buy it and drink it  we will report back with our insights  
thank you for feeding our addiction reddit 
a friend of mine bought this code and wanted to make this a gift for me  but i cannot redeem the code 
hi there  i am looking to buy an xbox but i can   decide between the series s or the series x  i have not found a straight answer while doing research online  i have never owned an xbox and only played a few times on a friend  xbox one  i have a    inch  k tv and only really want to get forza horizon   and forza horizon    i am currently looking into the series s because it is smaller and cheaper but also have the budget to get an x  if anyone could help with my desicion i would appreciate it  thanks 
 thank you everyone that commented with information  it was a big help  now that i have the info that i need i will contact my friend who has the series x to see if i can test it and then will figure out how i can test the s   
i still have the license for it but i was wondering if there was a safe way for me to re install  i heard there was someway to set up a proxy with your pc  but i have a mac is this still doable 
want to stock up on zs baja blast and dr  pepper zs 
i wanted to make a post about this because i myself was sucked into an mlm for a few months in sales and at first it seemed like a regular job  they go on about this  opportunity  to make it big and have a team and eventually be an  owner  or  be your own boss and work on your own time  kinda thing  
what they don   tell you upfront is that there isn   hourly pay only commission  and to be honest working for minimum wage in some cases is better than putting the time and effort into one of these  sales jobs  or  businesses   they expect you to work almost everyday all day come in early and work for little  sure you can make decent money  some weeks i pulled        but it  not what they make it  
the parent companies i   referring to are cydcor or smart circle which many of you may know 
however this is for people who don   and are young like i was  they normally target people who come fresh out of high school or college with little to no experience  and suck you in and tell you about how this is the best job you could ever have and screw going to school to do what you love and that it  a waste of time 
don   listen to them  if you find yourself at a job where it seems like they ' re begging you to be there or that they are thing to convince you that this is  the job  or that this is  your future  or that this is  an amazing opportunity  ask yourself this  do they need you more than you need them  
you never see a mcdonald  manager or dominos manager tell you  man this is a be your own boss you need to work here and i   take you under my wing so you can be as successful as me someday  
they don   need to  
points to take from this 
 if something seems too good to be true it probably is
 most jobs should be treated like they are a job  not a do this everyday   days a week something you hate type of thing 
 if someone is trying to convince you about something ask yourself why
 to protect yourself fro wasting your time google popular mlms and not so popular ones
let me know if i missed anything important for people who don   know much about mlms  #antimlm

it incorporates features of survival horror so that you can live a unique experience such as real settings ambisonic sound   d  a lovecraftian narrative and hyper realistic graphics

we ate there for my friend  birthday  and the tea we ordered  revolution ginger peach tea  tastes so much better when brewed in a proper pot rather than a mug  i  bought that brand flavor before for home    what sort of pot do they use to brew it and how much water for how long   can someone help me   i love tea but i   totally self taught when it comes to brewing it  i stem from coffee people so we have no tea tradition        links and comments appreciated   thank you for helping a noob 
watching the king k  rool reveal trailer on the ssbu direct last night i was struck by just how prominent the imagery from dk   both in the treehouse at the beginning and the middle part with dk island and king k rool  ship the laser beam etc ,
with king k  rool being put into the game despite not having been a featured antagonist for a while now in a dk game and with that dk   oriented imagery could this maybe indicate that we might be seeing some form of remake port on switch in the future 
noticed the series s are pretty easy to find  and relatively cheap  was gonna pick one up because for longest time i always thought they were exact same as series x but without disc drive  then i started looking into them and wondering is it worth upgrading from xbox one x  aside from graphical downgrades  the non existent load times seem nice 
okay does anyone know how i can make vietnamese iced coffee at home  i just had one today for the first time and i can never go back  problem is they are like       a pop and i can   afford that on a daily basis so i   thinking maybe making my own is an option  any help is very appreciated 
i got recruited by a guy i thought was going to be an actual mentor but ended up being apart of the recruitment process for ura  so far the guy who we are apparently trying to vie for mentorship from is rather intense and a kind of a joke  they spent    minutes in the first meeting explaining why they aren   like amway  currently in the second meeting and they are also still dropping hints of stuff about them not being an mlm 
​
at this point i don   care about getting accepted for the mentorship but i want to see what and how they act  so far i haven   been asked to pay for anything 
should i keep it up or should i just drop it 
update  they kicked me out today because i was poor but i recorded one of their super secret podcasts so they can suck it lol
​
my most searched thing for the switch is
 best eshop games  
the eshop is seriously needs a review feature now because i look at all these indie games and i can   tell if they are any good or not i  found some gems like membrane enter the gungeon blossom tales overcooked and steam world saga by searching online and by recommendations  
and then there are games like shovel knight hollow knight and dead cells that a a grade games that most people know about and things like hat in time that i am waiting for 
just a simple   star review system or a steam like thumb up or down review will do  i have spare money to spend on indies every now and again but i feel like i might be missing out on some great games that i have no idea exist 
its about   mbps with lan and   mbps without  however my normal download speed is around       mbps so i have no idea why the install speed is so slow
and i love it  time to go back to dollar general and buy a bunch more  probably my favorite mountain dew yet  https   i imgur com p goa e jpg
root beer is generally my go to soda  i like the more vanilla tasting ones  i can   help but think it would taste better without the minty flavor however  is there some kind of weird craft soda that has managed to make this  is that was sarsaparilla tastes like 
i got myself a   cup chemex i   using their brand white square filters that fold into a cone  following the george howell method i use    grams of coffee and     ml of water         using a    grind on my baratza encore and i use a bonavita gooseneck kettle 
after adding the grinds and leveling them i add   ml to bloom for   s then i add    ml increments every minute  problem is the water either pours in a solid flow    ml in like   seconds or dribbles down the spout and misses the chemex  dribbles down the neck onto the kettle   there  like no in between  i can   pour a thin steady stream it only comes out in a relatively fast pour  so the    ml of water fills up the chemex and drains from the center leaving a ring around the edges and a decent crater in the middle and then the water drains completely in   s and then    seconds of dry grinds before the next    ml dose  what should i do 
about a year or two ago my house was broken into and they stole my ps   i have since bought a new one and been playing games fine but it breaks my heart to see p t in my library but unable to download  it was my go to one quiet nights or whenever friends visit  loving the game so much i  been watching videos lately but wish there was a better way  does anybody know of any that could fill this endless void in my heart 
i don   get what  going on in here  all i know is i   thirsty and i   subbing
edit  that  what she said
just finished my review of ratchet and clank  https   www youtube com watch v fzz pk q g    and as someone that didn   really play the series as a kid i absolutely loved this game  i think it showed the the  d platfomer genre is alive and well  my question is what other series should get the same treatment  my first reaction is jak and daxter but with the new movie i think sly cooper makes more sense   
i want to start off with i am not looking into any of them i obviously would never even look that way because it  a terrible thing  
however i was wondering theoretically what would you have to do to succeed  how many people would you have to get under you and what amount would you have to sell to break even or even succeed 
also is there any that are easier to succeed in over others or are they all just so broken that there  none you could particularly succeed in  
how far of a down line would you need  how much would you actually have to do to see success in an mlm  
personally in my area arbonne is very very common and i looked into it one day and saw real figures and there was basically nothing you could do to even break even so it made me wonder in other ones and even arbonne what would you have to do to  succeed  
also why does it trap people in so easily  wouldn   you see the beginning numbers that you have to spend before even seeing a dollar not to mention break even on what you  done and immediately know it was a scam  
i   just curious and thought it would be interesting to talk about

i want a refund for ps plus and i am unable to find my transaction id 
they ' re all being made by the same company and they ' re the super generic simulation games that are half broken and are almost the same price as a full price game   why are these being allowed on the e shop   there  already two on there and a third one is releasing in a week 
i bought a gold set off of amazon and i love it  but i also thought about getting green to match the series x  but no one sells it in green  so i thought to paint it but not sure what kinds would be best 
i   fortunate enough to live about    miles away from the famed jungle jim  international market in eastgate ohio   i had heard some members of a british forum i frequent raving about the taste of a soda called irn bru   i decided to get a can and find out what it tasted like for myself 
it was   interesting   the soda was amber in flavor and very sweet   i   tempted to say it had a bit of a fruity tinge to it but i couldn   specify which fruit   a very hard to describe taste to say the least   the sweetness however made me decide that it really wasn   worth the       i spent on one can 
anyone else tried irn bru 
if you do and you ' re happy for me to use them in my thesis  i   give you the appriate credit that we can discuss  d
i believe it was lavender and chamomile  i got it at whole foods probably two years ago and it came in a matte gray mason jar  
it  one of my favorite pre bagged teas and i haven   been able to find it since i ran out 
looking to go buy it after the pandemic is over 
coastal areas only if possible 
is l e m o n in water acceptable  because it enhance taste
every time i try to save a clip of my game it either fails to save the proper amount of time i have set or just decides not to save the only part i actually want  and that  if i can even get it to pop up on the screen when i hit alt z  seems like every update it has a new problem how hard is it to properly record gameplay 
which is pretty awesome if i might say so myself 
it       and we still can   get new game releases on every platform simultaneously how can they keep getting away with it  beyond me 
you could say they are probably delaying the switch and pc version of crash   like they did with the previous remakes for  ouble dipping '  purposes because it  activision but how can you even defend and not bat an eye to such anti consumer practices  
let  say that  the case then how does that explain ctr still not being on pc  is it incompetence or they literally couldn   care less about the consumer  not everybody owns or can afford a console for a single game i   tired of all the uncertainty and having to hope and beg for a game to come out on my platform of choice  wake up activision it       
joycons fail all the time and this got me thinking  a deadzone sensitivity option would mitigate this big problem because right now we only have calibration and worse not all controllers support calibration  an unofficial third party pro controller that drifts  bad luck   you can   calibrate it  a deadzone sensitivity option would help quite a lot in these situations where calibration does not work 
i   not saying this would fix the drift  it would just alleviate it for all but the worst affected controllers 
i didn   really think a physical release would happen and was going to get it digitally but knowing there  a physical version coming out now makes me happy that i can just pick that up and save some money instead of buying it digitally and then they announce it physically releasing later which makes me spend even more money on it 
atm i  just got a really soft t shirt inbetween the screen and dock until my screen protector arrives and probably even then
yesterday morning i believe i accidentally put my light roast for pour over into the niche while it was still set on setting    for espresso  it stalled almost immediately 
i removed the beans as much as i could and managed to get working again but i reached out to niche concerns i had a faulty product  their reply is below 

light roasts can cause the grinder to stall at fine settings so i think it may be down to this 

i think this should be more widely known  i was pretty surprised that my niche was unable to handle light roast beans especially as i wouldn   consider    to even be that fine  even the niche faq states that they tested the niche with many different beans 
i notice a theme recently that when i don   have a job or not actively  involved  in my life i just can   enjoy games at all  i really don   even know why it  not a guilt thing and i   certainly not playing to much  i haven   in months 
there was a pc game i played as a kid in the early to mid   s  and i can   remember the name of it  the game had a top down perspective and at the end of a level there would be a blue portal that would take you to a different time period  it  not chrono trigger as i also played that game as a kid  in one time period i remember there was a pirate ship  in another it was an old western scene and i believe there was one level that took place in roman times  anyone have any ideas

a family member of mine who sells it posted something about this on facebook  i obviously felt the need to fact check and apparently it  true  
   but it turns out i  been brewing it all wrong  it  actually really nice when brewed right 
before i was brewing it with too much tea wasn   rinsing and was also brewing way too long  the result was something that just tasted strongly of a moist forest floor covered with decomposing fallen leaves 
now i measure ~   g into my tiny gaiwan  it  maybe    ml if you fill it to the very brim  rinse twice and decant the first few brews almost as soon as the gaiwan is full  totally different flavor leathery and sweet  the flavor  even better when i pry off one big chunk instead of chipping off a lot of smaller ones from the cake 
i   posting in case there are any others out there who don   get why anyone likes pu erh and maybe made the same mistakes as i did that keep them from appreciating it 
i   looking to purchase a teapot which is both functional and attractive  to me of course   i  had a look around and decided that ultimately i  prefer functionality over attractiveness  i found this 
https   www bodum com gb en           douro
i like the look of it but there seem to be no reviews anywhere and i   highly suspicious of the price reduction as a ‘new '  product  
basically i   stuck and i need some recommendations for good tea pots  what do you use and why would you recommended it 
all suggestions are welcome 
thanks

i only make coffee about     times a week because i have free coffee at work  is the     dollars worth it to get a lido e et

so i just bought quake on the switch  i love the game and was hoping for this port for a long time and i honestly couldn   even fathom that a game this old would ever struggle to run on this day and age even with slightly enhanced effects and a higher resolution  
but enter the switch and yet again another port suffers from sub par performance even from such an older game  i honestly think that doom   performed better overall  
i know its my fault i should have waited for further tests to show up online but i had a quick glance at reviews and they all said it ran at a solid    fps but i guess that must be the docked version 
this game is already not ideal on a controller but adding to that the frame rate drops when there is a slightly larger area or more enemies on screen and it becomes too sluggish to pay  i honestly wish i could refund it  and i   not even playing with all the extra effects on 
i   sorry for the negativity i   just venting because i   always sad when a game that i   really hyped for coming to switch arrives in a sub par state  specially something this old that the switch has no excuse to run below   fps 
also i might be missing something but is there anyway to disable the haptic feedback  it activates for every little thing which is annoying but i see no way of disabling it 
for anyone who was waiting for the option to invert your aim in jedi outcast the latest update has added it to the control options menu

the photo is a bargain i found at charity shop today    pound for gba sp with mario kart  this got me thinking why am i so excited for mariokart on switch seeing as i  played it to death on wii u 
my answers to myself are 


hopefully battle mode is good as me and my son love playing it on earlier mariokarts but not so much on wii u 


king boo is playable  he was my fave on wii 


  it  mariokart   that i can take out with me 
have you got mario kart   on wii u and will you get it on switch as well 
i feel there  enough to warrant purchasing it on switch even if you own it on wii u

i don   know if there is a lot of you who download f lux as their first thing after setting up their pc   but while is a good software who does its job there are other alternatives for blue light reduction that doesn   affect your pc  performance  because they poll the system every n ms to maintain the screen effect between status changes   
yes  if you have hickups micro stuttering or lagging f lux may be at fault 
i have cycled between some apps that offer what is called  blue light reduction  and i have two picks in case you are fed up with f lux or redshift 

sunsetscreen       
my personal best  i wanted an app who could secretly hide under the notification area applying sunset colour  <     kº  and modify the brightness at certain hour automatically  sunsetscreen does all of this without paywalls  
it also lets you pick your  day colour  if you want to modify the brightness and the color temperature at day  you can also manage the system polling or disable it and modify the transition phase between day and night 
also it works for multiple user accounts 

iris
i tested it not so long ago before setting up with sunsetscreen and iris is mind blowing in the customization options  advanced settings vary between managing every monitor individually setting curves for   h cycle time break site blocking and even blink detection 
~~the problem is that iris is very segmented  iris mini  free  iris mini pro iris lite and iris  some advanced settings may not be of use for you you should see the comparison table ~~
~~in short you buy time to use iris actively like a monthly subscription but it  not costly considering usd     for iris  sounds weird but it may be good for some people  but not me  ~~
edit  iris developer tackled the segmentation and now basically all iris versions are free except for iris mini pro  usd     and the full iris  usd       check out them and see if one of them fits your needs   at least for myself neither didn    
still not sold  check the web demo 

these are my two particular picks  if you know better just drop a comment but i don   think any app can win against these two 
   
update  why this is a trend 
basically getting off the blue tone of your screen   specially but not limited to nighttime   reduces eye strain  and even insomnia in some poor guys   ymmv but give it a chance  my eyes doesn   hurt anymore at       am  v
update  i   still having hiccups micro stuttering using these
try the following  open msconfig exe and disable all services  except for the microsoft ones  and software starting at logon  restart and test again for example opening the game where you experienced micro stuttering  if the problem is solved then review your software installed as one of them may be doing this kind of interference

i made sure i have notifications turned on  this just started yesterday and i can   seem to figure out how to change it 
any and all help would be much appreciated  i   new to the xbox family so i   not sure if this  is a thing

i wonder   
looking for some advice from others with high refresh monitors   i   currently on a   hz display so it  fairly straight forward to customize and tweak settings in order to maintain   fps 
however i   currently interested in upgrading to a     p    hz monitor and was wondering if the same principle applies 
will i need to maintain a constant    hz to avoid tearing or frame pacing issues   would i be better off capping performance somewhere lower around        hz if    hz is too demanding 
this will be on a oc      k with a    ,

i found this thing called a tea bag buddy for    at bed bath & beyond and i have to say i   pretty happy with it  you basically feed the string of the teabag through a slit in the top and place it on top of your tea cup with hot water  once it  done brewing you pull the string and squeeze out the teabag using the tbb  
this video explains it better than i do  
 the tea i   brewing is green tea tropical from mighty leaf  one of my favorites  
i   not trying to advertise this product or anything  i just like it  
listen homies i   over tired and over caffeinated right now and i didn   know where to post this

it  horrific seeing mlm type booths pop up at college organized fairs and events   doterra has been really active at my community college recently and their booth is always packed   i went up and talked to the people behind the booth and asked some general questions   when the questions started getting a little too specific one of the women actually asked me  what my purpose was  at the event as if i wasn   just a student checking out the fair 
i am livid but i don   want to react emotionally   what i do want to do is combine our resources on here and come up with a strategy of sorts for what to do when we see mlm booths pop up at school events   i would like a step by step process worked out   i would like a broad letter drafted possibly with the help of people over at r legaladvice or of other legal experts that can be a starting point for getting the notice of the higher ups or those in charge of these events 
the biggest wall we ' re up against is that while    k  members of this sub sound like a lot it  only a drop compared to the number of students attending college   most people i come across have no idea what mlm stands for or why it  so terrible   this includes staff at colleges   it gets even worse when you realize that there are definitely some staff that are a part of these mlms themselves and some are in charge of putting on these events 
we ' re too scattered as a knowledgeable group at this moment to be doing the good we could be doing   tearing down flyers is one thing but the flyers are always going to reappear   we have to stop the problem by its roots and that  going to mean getting pooling the information organizing it in a way that highlights the main issues with mlm companies and why they ' re so detrimental to students and creating a guide for how someone like me can begin the process of approaching college higher ups and start creating roadblocks for this type of scam 
what do you think about getting something like this started   honestly i have the urge to do it i just have no idea where to even start   i  like to get a conversation and plan of action going 
i got an achievement on goldeneye     that was worth   g and it messed up my gamerscore forever  
thanks to good h o memes people are hydrating
but as we all are internet dwellers i believe most of us are somewhat sleep deprived  let me tell you my story   i have been playing games and browsing the web every night consistently  since i was around    always going to bed after   pm  at least 
in high school i tried for a whole month to go to bed at  pm even if i was not tired and only allowed to read books past this hour  the first days were awful i was just staring at the ceiling and wanting to go on internet  but after some time my brain was catching on the new habit and i felt asleep easier  at the second week i felt asleep every night at  pm like a brick and was full of energy and positive emotions the following days
of course i did not maintain this good habit as parties and videogames took over my night time soon enough  but i remember vividly this period and i believe it was the only time in the past    years where i was actually getting some good rest
water is good sleep is good lets meme this generation into übermensch
ps  going to bed will reply tomorrow morning xoxo

i made the adjustment from console to pc gaming   years ago starting with crysis     i have a desk and room for gaming with the more popular setup but what is the downside to gaming on a      k tv rather than a   or   monitor setup at a desk

hey folks  relatively new to tea here  a combination of trying darjeeling for the first time starting a new job that i need caffeine for and a tea loving coworker all set me down the path of becoming a fledgling tea lover myself a few months ago

what are some of your favorites that you think a new tea lover absolutely must try 
hi everyone my dad talked about how he hasn   found any decaf coffee that he has liked so i want to buy him something as a gift but i know nothing about deacf are there any brand that stand out from any others  i tried to search if it has been asked before but i couldn   find a post about it
we are from sweden and he mostly likes dark or medium rost with no milk or suger 
bought it couple years back now cant see it in themes and on ps store  wth is going on 
i   interested in how long it took you guys to finish the campaign couldn   find anything and am considering buying it
edit  misspelled the post i mean  take  instead of  tale 
just booted up my console and had a look in my library to find pt in there  not had it downloaded since it came out  so i click on at and whatdoyaknow the game works 
maybe i just missed the memo but it was a surreal moment 
i fell down an mlm rabbit hole during one of the darkest times in my life  i have sank money we didn   have and had to listen to the awful awful women telling me that if i wasn   making enough money to be a stay at home mom that it was my own fault just work harder  i have been working through my issues and now i am finally done with the stupid mlm  looking back i feel so stupid for getting so wrapped up in it in the first place  it  like being brainwashed lol  
anyways i just wanted to share somewhere without starting drama with my many midwestern family members who are still apart of mlms so i thought i would share here 
i buy a lot of loose leaf teas  though i use tea bags at times too  and i   finding it difficult to be able to reuse my leaves after the first brew 
i e   i just brewed up a cup of some white tea and realized i had no place to put them or use them before they  go bad so i put them down the garbage disposal   it really bothered me to do that though 
to give some idea of my situation i   in an apartment  just moved in a week ago  so there  not a lot of  if any  planting growing on for me   i could have a little window sill flower garden but i   not sure if i want to do that or not 
i drink loose leaf tea roughly    x a week but will be more once things settle down for me  still moving stuff  
like i went from playing skyrim on medium bought a gaming pc put it to max with an enb and i loaded up running around a river in a village  almost cried it was so beautiful  
now it  sort of  meh   anyone else 
to elaborate more i remember drinking a purple soda can when i was younger and i swear the can had a little pineapple slice on the can 
so i   guess it was some sort of grape pineapple soda 
only thing i can think of that looks like it is welch  
i really think the pineapple slice i remember was the apostrophe in the name  ex  welch   the  '  was a little yellow pineapple slice 
edit  i think i  concluded it is welch  fruit punch soda 
i want to buy a game for myself this christmas i   undecided between these    i loved bf  and bf  also seems pretty nice also breakpoint caught my attention 
what do you think  if you played both of them witch would you recommend one over the other 
one of my favorite pastimes is reading the comment section on anti mlm instagram posts  the one thing i  notice staying consistent is r f claiming they ' re the #  skincare brand in america  but like     i  found no evidence anywhere of this  where are they hearing this   someone said  google it  you   see for yourselves   still nothing  does anyone have a link  reputable or not  for this info

i  tried googling it and searching youtube for an answer but i found no direct answer  i  thought of putting either vodka or cold brew jameson in the bottom but i   not sure what would happen  i don   want to ruin my moka pot or anything worse that could possibly happen in the process 
i usually look for an even combination of sweet and spicy  my two preferred ginger ales are blenheim and red rock ginger ale 
any new soda types  i remember dr pepper blueberry now that was good 
hi,
i ran across a chai mix  not instant but a pre made mix with real spices tea  that i fell in love with  but it  fairly pricey  i   sure it  fair for what it is but we ' re on a budget     
the ingredients are simple and few  they are  in order listed  
tea  they have two options one with black tea the other with rooibos 
cinnamon
cardamom
ginger
black pepper
cloves  
they even offer the spice mix without the tea  but i can get the ingredients even organic etc for a fraction of the price mixed  the company says that the guy who created this recipe did so from having traveled all around india and used their traditional ingredients and recipes   
i  never tried to recreate a recipe before and i   having trouble finding a recipe with just these ingredients online  does anyone know a  of a recipe that has the ingredients in it that i might start from or b  where would you start trying to recreate it yourself  i know ingredients are generally in the order of most to least in their listing but that  about all i know  
any ideas advice info would be amazing  thanks so much in advance 
i was playing skyrim on a road trip on an annoyingly sunny day and could barely see anything even with a torch and dark vision and the screen at max brightness  i was trying to find anything to help me see better in the settings and decided to try  change display colors  in the display settings monochrome helps quite a bit but invert colors helped a ton
like after drinking two cups i end up feeling super bloated and nauseous and oddly enough hungry  i  tried to drink the right amount of water a day but i just cant keep up  i end up having to wait for a little while before i can drink again  meanwhile i see people here and some of my own friends able to chug down an entire gallon practically 
i tried connecting it with my pc and it only connected with my pc for a few minutes and now it won   sync with my pc anymore   my xbox 
curious of how the members of pc gaming back up their save files  had a scare today where i was finishing up a play session of the witcher   and my computer froze right after exiting the game  i had to force restart since nothing else did worked  i rebooted the game to check if my save was ok and sure enough it was corrupted along with my game settings preferences  thankfully my quick save was still intact so i didn   lose my mind but i was close lol 
is anyone else following posts from the huge q science convention this weekend  so much cringe 
it makes me uncomfortable for the hun i know who is into it  she is very influential in our community so these conventions make me cringe extra because they encourage her to push more people into the 🔺 
there have been many times that i  had tasteless brews no matter how much adjustment i do  there have been times ive had very good brews to the point that i think i wouldn   have any problem with dialing in in the future but for some reason my v   just won   cooperate  ive tried so many things like changing the way i pour trying different ratios preparing brewing water but to no avail  i know i can do good brews with my aeropress or moka pot but i just want to have that sense of gratification that i can brew some good pourover especially when i have beans that are more suited to pourovers  how  you guys get your recipe down  or are there more experienced people on this sub that still have trouble with the v   
it seems to me like all my favourite sodas end up getting discontinued   josta from the   s is my alltime favourite soda and still have found nothing remotely close in flavour  antarctica from brasil is similar but lacks the spiciness   dnl  i e  upside down  up  was so much better than regular  up and i loved the bright green colour  red fusion was like a slightly fruity dr pepper that  to this day  was the most carbonated soda i ever remember  and aruba jam was the best sprite variation ever 
of course there were some truly awful flavours  who can forget pepsi jazz or ice fire   but why does it seem all the best ones are discontinued 
i just want to start by saying that i apologise if this is in the wrong place   please redirect my post as i consider suicide themes imporant to address

i don   know the best approach here  i  known the guy for a few years but only through a mutual game and we have mostly surface conversations  that is up until last night i was about to leave a party that him and i had formed  just text chatting through the in game system  and he suddenly said  hold up   i asked if everything was ok  that must have been the tipping point for him  i don   think anybodies really asked him out right  and he said that he just doesn   want to be alive anymore and that he keeps thinking about ending it  
i appeared tender and understanding  which i was  but could see red flags going up all around me  i tried to listen and absorb his concerns  clearly he  had no outlet for a long time  he really appreciated my help  but then he told me that he  going to need me a lot over the next few days because if he doesn   feel any better by the weekend he  going to just finish it  i told him that i can   be responsible for his life or death and that i don   deserve to have his fate weighing over me that he deserves a long full life and only he can make an active effort to start putting a true plan in place  but that if he needs to talk to reach out to me  or family   he seemed content with that but i didn   like the oddly calm end to our conversation  
how can help this guy if all i have is his username  
thanks in advance once again if this is the wrong place for this i  love to be redirected  i know the numbers for crisis lines but i don   know if they are applicable since i  literally be telling someone to follow a playstation id 
so im from california but i   in israel right now and i  been seeing a lot of soda flavors i wasn   aware existed and one  or two  of them is fanta exotic   there  the green one which i think has peach flavoring in it but there  also a purple one that has a little picture of a pineapple on it instead of the peach   i can   find the purple one anywhere online but it  been the main one i  been seeing around  and buying it  delicious    does anyone know what i   talking about 
i am on vacation in the united kingdom around the area of bradford and will be going to london soon i was wondering if there are any tea shops that anyone would recommend
please and thank you   
basically i   a poor college student and can   afford the expensive stuff on a daily basis  i  found that eight o ' clock coffee seems to be the pbr of the coffee world  they are the best cheapest beans i  found and are heads above the other standard cheap stuff 
so i   sure there is something else out there that is amazingly cheap for the quality  any suggestions 
not everyone has access to an open nat type even when changing the settings in your router  so is there any reason why nintendo does not allow nat type c d to connect while other games like monster hunter works with it 
i would generally consider myself a hydrohomie i dont drink alcohol i hate nestle purelife and i   always drinking water  the one soda i do drink is ginger ale not diet  i feel like it  not really like other sodas  it  thirst quenching and settles your stomach idk what do you guys think can we make an exception for ginger ale 
the only things amiss are dehydration  wha   😳  and low sodium  so they gave me a saline iv and told me to increase my sodium intake  truly i have practically no salt in my diet so yeah they ' re right about that  and they reminded me that without salt all the water i drink goes right through me & doesn   hydrate me  so huh til

i have some female friends who are housewives who have been very frequently getting these mlm pitches  plenty of them were high achievers in college or workplace before becoming housewives and many of these mlm shills like to  guilt trip them by implying that they are wasting their education and talent  also implying that they are deliberately burdening their husband by having zero income and not earning money to contribute to the family finance  one friend of mine even had her mil  who is actually earning decent salary teaching in college but wasting a lot of it on mlm  saying to her  don   you want to be independent rather than relying on my son  money to buy your panties and pads  
so housewives of this sub how do you normally respond 
can anyone help me source tropical mix sprite and pineapple fanta bottles in the uk or anyone able to buy and ship to me   
sonic forces is probably gonna be a must get for me because i love the unleashed colors generations gameplay 
i could get it on pc   or i could get it on the switch and take it with me 
i  liked binding of isaac for years despite sucking at it  i never got the expansions  i bought it for the switch because i can play it on pc   or i can take it with me 
 take it with me  seems like a powerful fight against my usual  if it  on pc i want it on pc  mindset  does the portability mean as much to everyone else  
edit  if your answer is  no i want it for indies and nintendo exclusives  congratulations your response has been noted      times  you don   have to throw another one into consideration 
i worked for an office just like this post
i don   even know the name of the parent company because each  company  had its own name  mine was called  mountain peak   here  what i do know 


each  company  has a  ceo  which recruits  team leaders  which have a group of three to four people working under them 


the purpose of the stuff we were  selling  was to get people to buy home depot   or costco   home remodeling services  kitchen cabinet refacing window or bathroom stuff roofing   we weren   actually taking payment for anything we were just signing up people for free estimates 


our job was to meet random customers of home depot and pitch them the free estimate using a script  i still have the script if y ' all are curious   we  often get kicked out of home depot because the karens would get  justifiably  huffy and contact a manager 


we were promised       us week for signing up a certain number of people  i never made        turns out it  that the certain number of people that buy the service from home depot as a result of my signing them up for the estimate  so for example if i had to sign up    people in a week all    of those people had to buy cabinet refacing or roofing or whatever  otherwise i wouldn   get my bonus 


if you meet one of these people don   feel obligated to sign up  do ask them sarcastic questions about how much they get paid that  part of how i wised up and quit 
eta  each of these ceos are only that on paper  i   pretty sure they have some sort of upline because they go to special  leadership conferences  and sometimes the team leaders who are doing really well get to go with them  there  gotta be some higher up somewhere that organizes these things so that means they ' re just part of the pyramid too 
my team leader took me and our team out  for drinks  on the first day    it was really just buying some liquor and mixer and plastic cups in the liquor store then hanging out in a parking lot to drink like a bunch of thugs  it was    very weird  the guy bragged about making his      a week but couldn   afford happy hour  should have been my first clue 
always felt like water  to me  it  got all the benefits of water and none of the additives of anything else 
trying to decide if i should pull the trigger 
does anyone know a co op game where my friend is the main character and i   just a side character that helps them

i boiled apple cider and then steeped a bag of  bengal spice   cinnamon ginger cardamom cloves  herbal and it was fantastic

any recommendations 
hi guys sorry if this question always gets asked but  i  recently bought a ps  and keep seeing people talking about b and c models  what is the actual difference  the one i  ordered is a b which i   not really bothered about   just wondering if there are actually any major differences i should be concerned about 
i  appreciate it if it was something from yunnan sourcing 
used to enjoy a grape soda but it  not old jamaica or ka or even bigga it was something else maybe purple and white can with red writing and i preferred it but can   remember who made it 
so my local supermarket used to carry stewart  key lime soda which is wonderful      then they quit carrying it    and i  had no luck finding it in other stores   i checked with stewart  and their csr couldn   find anyone who stocked it within a     mile radius from me  st  louis    i asked my local supermarket if they could order it but haven   heard back so i   guessing that  a  no  
does anyone have access to stewart  key lime soda in their local stores   maybe we can arrange a swap of flavors or something   
i originally played skyrim on pc with mods and i don   think i appreciated how much the unnoficial mod patch fixed things  my biggest complaint is that i  had over a dozen quests refuse to finish because the objective doesn   get added to my journal  i love this game and i   angry that    years later we ' re still haveing the same problems we always had 
edit  i   playing on the switch now so have no access to mods
my parents and in laws managed to both get me a nice grinder for christmas   so now i have a baratza virtuoso and a breville smart pro and need to pick one to return  i like the compact straightforwardness of the baratza but i   leaning towards keeping the breville because i  heard it spills less grounds on the counter  they seem pretty similar in capabilities   is there any compelling reason to pick one or the other 
thanks 
harney and sons tea brew for   minutes like the packaging suggests  this doesn   happen with earl grey or english breakfast is it because they ' re herbal not as strong as black teas 
when i bought the switch one of the biggest things i was excited for was the ability to play it in bed like an ipad  there are games like minecraft fortnite and blades which all have touch screen controls on their mobile version but lack that ability on switch  
why don   games let you ditch the controllers and use touch screen controls  i  played mario maker and the touch screen it good and responsive  
really with i could slide the switch into my bag or play it comfortably in bed on my couch  just disappointed this feature isn   supported 
my friend just told me i   not a true hydro homie because i don   drink seltzer  i feel attacked  i think it  disgusting i can   help it  what  y ' all  opinion on this travesty

hey yall  i   new here and i  been trying to find a replacement portafilter for my krups xp     because the handle  starting to get a little loose  as i was scrolling thru the internet apparently not many brands produce a   mm portafilter with   ears anymore  so if i bought the ones with   ears and have the same basket size and everything would it still fit

i originally wanted to go with the oxo brand variable temp kettle but it looks like it  sold out every where  i   not sure if the product is being phased out or if quarantine has caused stocks to run dry  
besides the stagg ekg is there another tried and true variable temp gooseneck kettle that the community consistently recommends 
few months ago i was addicted to sodas  i would rarely drink water usually a cup or two a day and would just drink sodas constantly 
recently i started drinking more water  the main reason for this was just to clear up my acne but i still do it  i rarely drink sodas now only around a couple of times a week or not at all  i still drink juice but i balance it out by drinking around     cups a day  
this sub motivated me a lot so i gotta say thanks to you guys 
just a problem for you guys,
every time i try and launch fifa    on my xbox one after it says  ready to play  it redirects me to error code  x  e     
hi all 
i recently bought my first espresso machine  breville barista express  to supply me with both my all too important caffeine and a new semi hobbie during the quarantine   i  gotten pretty good at dialing in grind size and dose to limit sourness and bitterness in my morning shot but something is missing  
when i visit my local coffee shop  where i buy my beans  and get a latte the citrus aftertaste cuts through the chocolatey undertones of the coffee  however when i brew the same beans at home the depth and sweetness are lost  
basically what i   asking is  is this my fault  are there more variables i can adjust to unlock this depth or is it simply a limitation of my machine and built in grinder 
any advice would be great thanks 
anybody know of a green tea brand with high egcg content 
preferably bagged but if you guys know of a good loose leaf brand i   check it out 
i know lipton has average of like   mg of egcg per cup or something which is not bad i think 
anybody know of a better one that  standardized

i love the game and the souvenir hunts are fun but it  really tedious to have to keep exiting the level only to get another souvenir hunt   in the same level  there  no reason nintendo couldn   have let you find multiple objects in a level at once other than the fact that they didn   want to  obviously normal mode and flip side mode hunts would be separate but come on nintendo this was a dumb decision 
iv been brewing white tea in a gaiwan for some time now and iv noticed when i let it steep for more that  min and    secs  that  how i usually drink it  it starts to get kinda bitter  am i doing something wrong or is it supposed to taste like that 
i   honestly pretty floored about finding this out on linkedin today  our brand director   essentially one of the heads of our entire marketing department that supports   major brands   has been slinging rodan fields for six years  
anyone with even the slightest marketing knowledge knows mlms are garbage  she  also a horrible fit for our team and is actually proud that no one likes her  i can   believe she was hired with that on her professional resume  like that should be a huge red flag to hiring manager in marketing  
does it run good etc    asking first before i buy  the price seems a bit high for a game that  been out for ages 
i ran into an old high school teacher today and she tried to get me to join r f  i knew from her facebook page that she was a part of it but i was genuinely surprised that she wanted to get me into it  i   not in the best financial situation right now so of course she starts saying stuff like  well if you have some extra money to invest in yourself to start your own business     and she wanted me to message her  she wasn   overly pushy or rude but i don   like that predatory nature  she knows i   in a bad place financially and she  suggesting that i invest what money i have into a  business  that has no chance of working in my favor 
i   just curious to hear what everyone thinks didn   get nearly enough praise as they thought should  of course there  gonna be a lot of different answers so please respect everyone  opinions  thanks for anyone who reply  
as the questions says  i was wondering how many people play a game solely and finish it before moving on to the next  compared to playing multiple games at the same time  for example i   playing the witcher    blood and wine and evil within right now  i   play the witcher some days then evil within on other days 
my wife and i have been enjoying our at home espresso ritual for a few years  as far as gear goes we prioritized putting funds into the grinder first  we still use the baratza preciso and figured one day we  upgrade our cute little plastic delonghi  we ' re probably a bit past due but it  time for the upgrade 
the only catch is i  been out of the game for a bit as i took a break from coffee for health reasons  as such i   not up to date with any recent trends  
i viewed the general buyer  guide in the wiki and a few similar posts from the last year so here  a little more about us which might help reduce the options 
important 

the quality of the steamer microfoam  of course espresso is important but the steamer is actually a big reason i want to upgrade
will be used for   milk drinks at a time

less important 

i prefer semi automatic but she  open to automatics
companies known for their customer support
turn key solutions are nice but i   happy to tinker customize if necessary
i enjoy the coffee community like this sub so it could be fun to get a machine which is popular among enthusiasts
  k is a loose range happy to spend a little less or a little more
we ' re in the usa  i know the silvia can be expensive here 
i   open to second hand and we live in san francisco so perhaps we have slightly higher chances

hi guys looking for a game to couch coop with a mate  all of the sites recommend games like overcooked death squared etc  but we are looking for a shooter or something else that isn   puzzle based but more skill based 
they all use sucralose and aspartame which i find disgusting 
i have ps  but unfortunately forza it  exclusive in series x and i saw a lot of videos of fh  i think it  an amazing game so i   wondering it  worth buying xsx for fh 
back when the xbox was launched i remember that game stores had a thin booklet that gave x  some number  reasons why xbox was best you should buy it  a few things it talked about were the power of the system having a built in hard drive for saving games bragged about the controller being beefier and tougher than the controllers other consoles had made fun of the noise the dreamcast made and promised years of support for the console 
does anyone remember this  i  been looking for a digital copy of this booklet for ages 
if i buy this monitor does it work on my ps  
i searched through the vendors list and found many oolong options but couldn   find tea leaves for hibiscus and tulsi  holy basil   anyone know any good sources to get these from 
my xbox series x is connected to my samsung g  monitor and i enabled hdr as i play ghost recon breakpoint  
 kuhd @  hz and as i play the screen goes black for a couple seconds as hdr keeps switching on and off    driving me nuts  any suggestions  
my hdmi is connected properly  everything works fine without turning on hdr  maybe i have some settings wrong on one of the devices  
a while back hdr was on while i played valhalla and i didn   have this issue  but i can   remember the exact way i had the settings 
hi,
i currently own a bialetti moka pot and i am getting nice coffee    sometimes  i find it really difficult to get repeatable results with it  i measure everything  coffee water temp flame even the time of extraction but i got different flavors from same parameters  
so i   thinking in getting another method  currently debating between aeropress and chemex  
my main interest is in a method where i will have control of more parameters and proved to give repeatable results 
i think aeropress would be winner what do you think 
my method involves going commando in a big jug and then straining through a colander and then again through a paper filter  it is cheap because there  no special equipment and it is as simple a concept as you can get but it can be messy  today i had a paper filter break and some sediment wound up in my brew  i   gave to either filter again or deal with the grit 
so home baristas tell me of better ways preferably without a big price tag 
i set nextdoor up for my neighborhood over a year ago  which may or may not have been a mistake we shall find out  and for the most part things have been good lots of lost found pets neighborhood watch alerts ads for yardwork services etc  unfortunately in the last month or so a bunch of posts for rodan and fields and scentsy have popped up and unfortunately we all know why    it  so sick how these companies prey on people during hard and uncertain times 
anyone who has used nextdoor   if you reported mlm posts did you find they were taken down or did nextdoor basically ignore it 
anyone else find it annoying that you cannot invert the y axis  this the way i play literally all my games  i don   understand the decision here   
i literally only want one of the next gen consoles to play halo infinite with my dad  i heard that the series s has inferior graphics and processing power compared to the x but is it really that noticeable in infinite  it  all i   be using the console for and at this point given the availability i   seriously considering the s 
ps hope everyone has a happy holiday except for scalpers  hope you have the worst holiday ever and your christmas tree sets itself on fire

i  been in the specialty coffee scene for a year or so now and would like to expand my horizons to tea as well where should i start  i already have a kettle for now and was curious as to where to look for great quality teas and the like  anything to get me started really 
hey guys i  had my ps  pro for about   years now and its sounding like a jet taking off every time i play any game that requires the tiniest amount of processing power 
its about time to open her up and remove all the dust and hopefully that   solve it  what is the can of air called that i   need to clean it  
i   uk based and wanted to sort this today so does anyone know if there any shops that   still be open which could sell it  i was thinking maybe b&q i know their still open 
thanks in advance 
i gotta hecka shows i  bought over the years but the sony video part of the ps  feels like it was never thought out  it  so clunky i have to pick each season even if the season end and i own the following season i still have to exit out and find it  if i finish a season the next time i watch it i have to rewind it     like what in      is going on here if sonys releasing an all digital ps  they better do some work on it cause it  a clunky pile of dog farts right now  is there an app or something that works with the psn purchases 
if you are using logitech g hub which most people are if using any of logitech  more robust products check your cpu usage  i was going crazy repasted my cpu etc trying to bring my idle temps down  it turns out that logitech g hub has crazy resource usage problems and it seems the issue goes back over a year  this has been causing me all sorts of problems with my normal workload and hopefully i can help anyone else running this software 
they are england  london  france  paris  germany switzerland liechtenstein italy  venice  and austria 
obv this is a business synergy thing but everyone involved would seemingly make money from remastering old mario party kart mario   tennis etc  to new standards and re releasing for    bucks each  id pay it   
was at the grocery store this morning  aldi  and they had a bodum french press for sale pretty cheap and i decided to get myself a little present   
up to now i  only ever made coffee at home with an automatic drip so i wasn   sure exactly what to expect  i   pretty sure i followed all the instructions exactly  though they didn   make it easy to figure out how much coffee to use for a full pot  and the result is blowing my mind  the same beans i  been drinking for weeks taste  completely  different with this method in the best possible way  now i  got no choice but to upgrade to a burr grinder lol
i tried living with a console for   months and i just can   do it anymore  after much deliberation i  finally spent way too much money and bought myself a prebuilt pc 
my series x tried it  best it  incredible hardware and slick software impressed me initially but it didn   take long for the limitations of a console to show  so many games are still stuck at   fps despite the xbox team  valiant efforts with fps boost  then i  had issues with utilizing my monitor fully and struggling without a proper audio out system  you just can   beat the flexibility a pc provides 
anyway i   preaching to the choir here   
my last pc had a gtx      and a very old cpu which heavily bottlenecked my system  now i   going to be gaming on an rtx     ti with a     x  i can   wait to try out some sweet rtx and try dlss for the first time 
so excited to come back home    😁
can someone explain why this sub exists  how is the sub about water so popular
